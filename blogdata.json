The most common spots for this are the main entrance to your home, the path from the living room to the master bedroom, going into the master bathroom and where your feet sit when you sit on your favorite couch or chair. Basically they are the areas of the house that have the highest concentration of soil and traffic. We call these areas traffic lanes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What happens is through everyday use of the carpet, concentrations of dirt and soil pile up inside the carpet and this alone causes the areas to begin to look dark. Over time, however, these areas can begin to wear down because of the excessive foot traffic in these areas. These two factors combined begin to actually cause abrasion of the fibers over a relatively short period of time, causing the area to begin to look even darker and cause irreparable damage to your carpet. This can cause the carpet to appear matted in areas. You may also notice a bit of a shadowing effect because of the fact that light will refract off of the fibers instead of reflect due to the abrasion of the carpet fibers themselves. This process is especially relevant to us here in Houston because of the excessive pollen in the air during the springtime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Different carpets will have different levels of resistance to traffic lanes. Polyester carpets will wear much easier than any other material of carpet. Nylon and berber carpets are much more resilient to wear damage, but it can still happen.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>That sounds horrible! What can I do to prevent this?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a few different ways to combat traffic lanes and dark pathways forming in your home. The first and easiest step is regular vacuuming. You can read our article about proper vacuuming habits&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.deckerscarpetcleaning.com/how-to-vacuum/\">here</a>, but we would recommend about once or twice per week. This is possibly the most important thing you can do for your carpet for a number of reasons, but most importantly it helps fight back the soil buildup in these areas.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another thing you can do to prevent traffic lanes is regularly having your carpets professionally cleaned. You can read our article on how often you should clean your carpets&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.deckerscarpetcleaning.com/how-often-should-i-clean-my-carpet/\">here</a>. In that article we also discuss having a maintenance plan for your carpet, which is a very easy and cost effective way to stay on top of this.&nbsp;</p>", "created_on": "2022-03-28T21:51:36.239Z", "meta_description": "Does your carpet have dark pathways?", "image": "", "image_alt": "none", "status": 1}}, {"model": "Deckers_Carpet_Cleaning_Site.post", "pk": 2, "fields": {"title": "What Do I Do Once My Carpets are Cleaned?", "slug": "what-do-i-do-once-my-carpets-are-cleaned", "author": 1, "updated_on": "2022-03-28T21:54:08.046Z", "content": "<p>What To Do After Your Carpet Cleaning Service Now that your CARPETS are clean, here are a few important things to keep in mind. Following these tips will help keep your carpets looking fresh and prevent any adverse effects after cleaning your carpets.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Airflow is Key</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first and most important thing to make sure of after cleaning your carpets is to make sure they dry properly. Start by turning on any ceiling fans in the house and placing any standing fans you have in the rooms that were cleaned. If the weather permits, you can open any windows in the house as well, but living in the Houston area this can be a bit unpredictable. You can set your HVAC system to &ldquo;Heat&rdquo; to help reduce drying times. The system can be set to any temperature to whatever you like, as long as the fan is running.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Minimizing Traffic</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Try to minimize traffic through areas of carpet that have been cleaned as much as possible until it is completely dry. Even a small amount of water can loosen soil from feet, shoes and paws, re-soiling the carpets. When you must walk on damp carpet, make sure it is without shoes and only with clean feet or clean socks. When walking on freshly cleaned carpet, be extremely careful! Walking from damp carpet to dry hard floors can be very slippery. Something you can do to help with this would be putting towels down at transitional areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Vacuum</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once your carpet is completely dry, it will be safe to vacuum. Some carpets may feel stiff after cleaning. Vacuuming will help to loosen the fibers and restore softness. However, vacuuming wet carpet is dangerous. We recommend waiting at least 24 hours before vacuuming even if your carpet feels dry to the touch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Call Us</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have any questions or notice any areas of concern, please call us as soon as possible.

The question we hear most often from customers is &ldquo;How often should I clean my carpets?&rdquo;. The answer is actually a little more nuanced than you might think and depends on several different factors including the material of the carpet, how often you vacuum (see our article on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.deckerscarpetcleaning.com/how-to-vacuum/\">How to Vacuum Properly</a>&nbsp;), and how many residents and pets are in the house.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A general rule of thumb answer is every 12 to 18 months under normal circumstances. However, you may notice your carpet becoming soiled more frequently than this. If that is the case, you may want to consider a more regular maintenance plan that includes two or four cleanings per year (or more in commercial environments).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Why should I clean my carpets so often?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is important to get started on a maintenance plan before your carpet becomes visibly dirty. The reason for this is that carpets begin to hold dirt and soils deep in the base of the fibers before the carpet begins to show signs of being soiled. These will begin to, through the daily use of the carpet, cause abrasion to the carpet fibers which can lead to irreparable wear damage. This is in addition to the obvious fact that less dirt in the carpet is easier to clean out than more.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be great if I could set up a plan for this?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We actually offer a maintenance plan called the &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.deckerscarpetcleaning.com/stay-beautiful-club/\">Stay Beautiful Club</a>&rdquo;. The way this works is, you have your carpets cleaned by us at your initial cleaning. Then, in 6 months we will come back and touch up your traffic lanes and open areas. Then, in another 6 months (at the One Year mark) we come back and, moving your light to medium furniture, provide a full regular cleaning just like we do at your initial cleaning.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You pay for your initial cleaning at the time of service. Then, you invest 10% of the cleaning price each month as your monthly Stay Beautiful Club payment. As you can see, your 6 month Touch Up cleaning and Emergency Spot Cleaning are nearly free!

Proper vacuuming can (and should!!) be done at home between regular carpet cleanings to keep your carpet looking great all year! Knowing how to vacuum properly is quite possibly the most important thing you can do at home to keep your&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.deckerscarpetcleaning.com/\">carpet cleaner</a>&nbsp;and help your carpet last longer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>So, Why should you vacuum?</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Your carpet is a filter.&nbsp; It traps the dust that blows around in your house that would otherwise be loose or airborne. Vacuuming helps remove remove everyday soils, pet hair and pet dander, dust, spores, pollen, and other gross stuff that gets walked, carried, or blown in from outside or created inside your home.&nbsp;These indoor air pollutants contribute to sinus problems and many other health issues.&nbsp; Like any filter, it should be emptied or cleaned on occasion to continue working properly. Indoor air quality starts with proper vacuuming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vacuuming also helps keep the carpet looking fresh longer by separating and standing up the fibers and removing the soil. Over time debris will collect in the carpet fibers and cause abrasion to the fibers. This will create distorted fibers that refract light instead of reflect light causing dark traffic lanes throughout the heavily trafficked areas of the house. Allowing soil to build up and work its way deep into carpet fibers also stains some carpets. Traffic lanes look dark and dingy and filtration lines build up around doors and furniture.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Here&rsquo;s some tips to help you vacuum more efficiently and effectively.&nbsp;</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We recommend using a vacuum with HEPA filtration. First, check to make sure your vacuum bag or canister is empty for optimal suction power. Plug the vacuum in to the closest electrical socket outside of the room you are about to vacuum, this allows you to move quickly through the room without tripping over the cord.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If your vacuum has a detachable hose and an angled edge attachment (or crevice tool), start by using this tool to clean the edges of the carpet along the baseboard.This often forgotten step leads to black lines on the carpet, known as filtration lines. You can also vacuum around the edges of any furniture in the room the same way. Open the doors and get all around the door jamb on both sides and behind the doors.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next, start in the furthest corner and move horizontally through the room slowly (about 2 feet per second), making small even rows with your vacuum cleaner. Each row should be about two to three feet long. Overlap on each pass, and on each row. Repeat this process throughout the entire room until the entire room has been covered with the vacuum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In rooms with heavy traffic lanes, such as the entrance to the living room, by the couch and from the master bedroom to the master bathroom, you want to go over these areas in different directions. Once you finish one pass (North to South) turn and do another pass (East to West). Multiple passes in multiple directions will shake more debris loose and pick it up more effectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>How often should you vacuum?</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Houston and the surrounding areas are known for pollen and dust problems. Vacuuming regularly can help improve the air quality in your home. It is recommended that you vacuum your carpets once per week per person or pet in the house. However, we know this usually adds up quickly and you have a life to live, so once in the little used areas and twice per week in the common areas will usually do the trick. When you see debris and hair &ndash; its past time to vacuum!<br />\r\nIf you have an especially hairy pet who sheds heavily, and extra round per week wouldn&rsquo;t hurt. Maybe you have a Golden Retriever like our Zeke? If so you probably vacuum twice a day and can&rsquo;t keep up!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFollowing these steps to vacuum correctly will help to reduce damage to your carpet from daily wear and tear, keep your carpet cleaner for longer, and improve the indoor air quality of your home.</p>", "created_on": "2022-03-28T21:56:45.691Z", "meta_description": "Many people are vacuuming their house wrong!

Many of our Houston area customers call us because they are frustrated with their tile and grout cleaning efforts. It seems you mop and scrub but never get the grout clean. You may even have a film on the tile that you can&rsquo;t remove. Well, there&rsquo;s some science to tile cleaning and we&rsquo;re going to share a few tips.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>7 Secrets to Keeping your Tile Floor Looking Fantastic</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>We have seen hundreds of tile floors just like yours, and we have studied tile cleaning and mop strategies. Follow these easy tips to help you to maintain a clean ceramic tile floor. If, after following these steps, you still cannot get the floor clean, it may be time to call a professional floor cleaner. It is also important to point out, stone floors are a different subject altogether. Some of these tips are good for stone floors, but some of them are not. If you are not sure what you have, give us a call and we can help you.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<ol>\r\n\t\t<li>Sweep or vacuum often. Sweeping helps to reduce wear and scratching by removing dry particles that scratch at the surface of your tiles. We suggest using a vacuum or a fuzzy dust mop. Standard brooms can leave small particles behind and drag soil over the top of a tile. Vacuums remove the soil through, well, lifting it away. Dust mops trap the soils. The use of door mats and removing shoes will also help reduce the amount of dry soil.</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Clean up spill immediately. Acidic drinks (or animal urine) can penetrate the grout and &ldquo;open the pores&rdquo; so that dirty mop water soaks down deeper when you try to clean. Spills can leave stains and are sticky, so dirt will be attracted to it. Spills can also damage the finish on some tiles, so cleaning it up quickly is in your best interest.</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Mop your floor on a regular basis using a&nbsp;<strong>NEUTRAL pH</strong>&nbsp;floor cleaner. Standard floor cleaners sold in the store are alkaline based. Alkaline cleaners meant for everyday use attract soil and become dirt magnets on your tile and in your grout. The more you mop, the worse the grout gets. Vinegar is a popular cleaning trend, but doesn&rsquo;t clean well. Vinegar is acidic, and so is most of the soil on your floor. If you remember a little bit of chemistry, you will not get much of a reaction using a similar pH. Vinegar with Baking Soda gets a reaction, but also leaves a residue (Dirt Magnet) In a vinegar/baking soda mix, the opposite pH levels are actually fighting each other rather than the soil. Any cleaning is secondary due to the violent reaction. Vinegar, being acidic, will open the pores of the grout and cause liquid to penetrate deeper into the grout.</li>\r\n\t\t<li>You will want to mop using a proper technique. We suggest a 2 bucket system, where one bucket has your neutral pH cleaning solution, and one bucket has rinse water. Dip your mop into the cleaning solution, wring it out a little, and apply it generously but not splashy &ndash; you don&rsquo;t want water running everywhere! You do want it to soak a little bit. What the professionals call dwell time &ndash; like soaking a dirty pan for a little while before cleaning it. If your grout is really bad, now is a good time to scrub it with a grout brush. Wring the mop out and then rinse it in clear water. Then wring it out again and mop up the cleaning solution and soil using a figure 8 pattern &ndash; pulling the water and soil towards you and towards the center of your mop pass. Once its picked up, clean and wring your mop in the clear water and repeat the process until the floor is clean. The point is, you want the cleaning solution to be as free from soil as possible, and you want to pick up the dirty mop water as fast as possible. If you&rsquo;re fighting a real battle&hellip; a wet/dry vac comes in handy to quickly remove the dirty mop water!</li>\r\n\t\t<li>The best water to use is distilled or softened water. Alkaline deposits in hard water build up on your floor causing a dull finish and streaks. The alkaline in the water also works against the cleaning solution you are using. The less you&rsquo;re fighting your water, the better it will clean for you. Follow up your mopping with a towel dry. Those pesky water spots get harder to remove the more they build up. If you have a fan to move air over the area and dry it faster, use it.</li>\r\n\t\t<li>If your grout is dark from soap and soil soaking in, you may have to do some heavy restorative cleaning. Use an acidic tile cleaner made specifically for restoring grout and follow the directions closely. Cleaning with an acidic tile cleaner will help to break down the alkaline soaps and make the grout easier to get a deep clean. You must neutralize the acid by cleaning with an alkaline or sealing with a quality sealer (once its REALLY CLEAN or you&rsquo;ll regret it). This is a really good time to utilize a wet dry vac to get the dirty water up quickly. We recommend leaving this kind of cleaning to the professionals, but that&rsquo;s not always possible.</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Once your grout is clean, seal it with a quality sealer. Sealers will slow the penetration of liquids and make future cleaning easier. Some floors are &ldquo;too far gone&rdquo; for even a professional cleaning to make look new again. These floors are great candidates for a Color Seal.</li>\r\n\t</ol>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h4>When To Call in a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.deckerscarpetcleaning.com/tile-and-grout-cleaning/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Professional Tile Cleaner</a>?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Ceramic Tile should be cleaned every 2-4 years unless under a regular and quality tile maintenance cleaning plan. The grout will &ldquo;allow&rdquo; for a small amount of soil penetration each year &ndash; dirt just works it&rsquo;s way in there. A standard cleaning can remove about 4 years of soil. There are variables that can increase the frequency needed, like how often and how well it is mopped, are there kids, pets, lots of soil from the yard or garage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Was the tile sealed? Of course, dirty mop water and spills soak in much faster on unsealed tile. Your 4 year cleaning cycle just got reduced to 2 years. Most sealers have a 3 to 5 year effectiveness on indoor grout. It&rsquo;s important to discuss proper sealer here. You NEVER want to wax or use &ldquo;mop on shine&rdquo; products. You will eventually pay 3 to 4 times as much to fix the problem caused by the waxy buildup. You should also never use a topical sealer indoors (and almost never outdoors). It will eventually wear, and some yellow over time. These are very difficult (read expensive) to strip.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Does it still look awful after your best cleaning attempt? Do you just not want to spend the time needed to get it done right? We have the experience, tools, and products to get it done right in much less time than you spending your spring weekends with a toothbrush on the grout in the kitchen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Tile Floor  Cleaning in progress\" src=\"https://www.deckerscarpetcleaning.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Tile-Cleaning-1.png\" style=\"height:677px; width:508px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re having trouble getting it clean by mopping alone, you may need a professional cleaning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-If you would like a free in home consultation about your tile floor, you can give us a call at &ndash; 281-973-0281.</p>", "created_on": "2022-03-28T21:58:01.586Z", "meta_description": "Tile Floors can be difficult to keep clean, here are 7 tips from the pros to help you out!", "image": "", "image_alt": "STRING", "status": 1}}, {"model": "Deckers_Carpet_Cleaning_Site.post", "pk": 6, "fields": {"title": "Remove the Smell of Cat Urine from Carpet", "slug": "remove-the-smell-of-cat-urine-from-carpet", "author": 1, "updated_on": "2022-03-28T22:00:06.607Z", "content": "<p>Cat lovers know that sometimes the odor associated with cats can be offensive, especially with cats who mark, spray, or pee in areas other than the litter box or outdoors.

If this is the case, you will either replace the wood sub-floor (in more extreme cases) or clean the sub-floor and seal it with odor blocking paint primer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you inspect and deal with the sub-floor and the padding and are sure the carpet has no more urine in it, your only recourse is to continue to use a professional quality odor eliminating product and flush it through the smelly area allowing as much dwell time as possible.&nbsp; We use Fresh Wave and can supply it for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Handling Stubborn Odors</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>There are times that the odor will NEVER be removed from a textile, and this is especially true in the case of area rugs with glued on backings or carpets with thick glued on backings.&nbsp; Sometimes the item will need to be replaced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the pee spot is not in an easy to work with corner, you may still pull the carpet all the way back, but it will need to be stretched back into place after it is loosened and the job complete.&nbsp; If you would rather not pull back that much carpet, you can use enzymes to digest any remaining bacteria or use odor eliminating products such as Fresh Wave.&nbsp; You can flush the area as described in our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.deckerscarpetcleaning.com/cleaning-old-pet-stains-from-carpet/\">cleaning&nbsp;old&nbsp;pet stains from carpet</a>&nbsp;blog post.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The area can be saturated with enzymes and allowed to dwell for DAYS. &nbsp;As long as there are odor causing bacteria in the carpet, pad, or sub-floor, the enzymes will continue to reproduce and consume the bad bacteria.&nbsp; The odor will increase as the enzymes kill the bacteria but dissipate as the process works. You must be sure to use enough enzymes to complete the job, and then rinse the area afterwards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can also use a syringe and inject deodorizers directly into the affected area.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Maybe It&rsquo;s Not The Carpet</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>If the odor is not&nbsp;coming from the carpet, these are some of the steps you will want to try, not necessarily in this order.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Inspect the areas with an ultraviolet light to find all urine deposits. Clean each deposit found.</li>\r\n\t<li>Clean and deodorize all baseboards, walls, bottoms of shelves, ceiling, behind the refrigerator, in the closets, anywhere that odor, dust, hair, and dander can accumulate, or areas that the cat can spray, urinate, or mark.</li>\r\n\t<li>Have all soft items cleaned with urine removal in mind, such as drapes, upholstery, blankets, mattresses, stuffed toys, clothing, etc.</li>\r\n\t<li>Have air ducts cleaned.</li>\r\n\t<li>Utilize an air scrubber, ozone machine, hydroxyl generator, or other device to clean the air.</li>\r\n\t<li>Remove and replace items that are physically damaged and holding an odor. Sometimes baseboards or furniture can absorb urine and hold onto odor forever. The only remedy is to cut the damaged area out and replace it.</li>\r\n\t<li>Use an odor blocking primer to prime the walls. Then trim and repaint the area. A properly prepped coat of primer and paint can do wonders to help remove odors from an area.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>Final Thoughts</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>It is also important to note that if the cat is still present, the cat may mark the area as soon as you finish cleaning it. Keep this possibility in mind before you spend lots of money on extensive repairs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We should also point out that in some circles bleach&nbsp;is recommended to remove the smell of cat urine from hard surfaces.&nbsp; We strongly advise against&nbsp;using bleach to remove cat urine odors.&nbsp; Urine deposits can develop high levels of ammonia, especially true with cat urine.&nbsp; Mixing bleach and ammonia can kill you&nbsp;or at least create gasses that can cause respiratory and other mucus membrane damage.&nbsp; If your urine situation is so bad that wagering against death is an option for you&hellip; you should probably&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.deckerscarpetcleaning.com/book-now/\">call a professional</a>!</p>", "created_on": "2022-03-28T22:00:06.607Z", "meta_description": "Cat Urine can be especially difficult to remove from carpet.

Sometimes you find the pee because of the odor you (or your guests!) experience.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.deckerscarpetcleaning.com/cleaning-fresh-pet-pee-from-carpet/\">Treating a fresh urine spot</a>&nbsp;is usually easier, but there is hope for older stains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are working with dog urine, you&rsquo;re a bit more fortunate.&nbsp; Dog pee is water based and easier to break down and remove than cat pee.&nbsp; The reason cat urine is hard to remove is because it is oil based.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Tools You Will Need</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>To go about cleaning old pet stains&nbsp;from carpet you will need a few items.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>A black light (ultraviolet light) to identify urine in the carpet.</li>\r\n\t<li>Clean water and a bucket or carrying vessel.</li>\r\n\t<li>Vinegar or Commercial strength Urine Pre-Cleaning Treatment* (We Can Provide)</li>\r\n\t<li>Pet Odor Enzymes* (We can provide)</li>\r\n\t<li>Odor Eliminator* &ndash; NOT a cover up scent!

We utilize a black-light and moisture probe to identify all pee spots that we can before beginning treatment. This is best done in the darkest room possible. Mark the spots with sticky notes, chalk, poker chips, paper scraps or something that will allow you to find the entire issue and plan your remediation.&nbsp; Keep in mind that urine spreads as it hits the sub-floor, so what you see on top is sometimes only half the size of the real issue.</li>\r\n\t<li>First you will want to vacuum the dried urine spot slowly and thoroughly to remove as much soil as possible. Sometimes spots wick back due to the amount of soil on and in the carpet.&nbsp; You must do your best to control this soil and prevent wicking or soil rings. Remember to replace your markers if dealing with multiple spots.</li>\r\n\t<li>Next, you will need to soak the spot with mixture of water and 3% Vinegar solution. Regular store bought vinegar is usually 5%, so dilute it 3 parts vinegar to 2 parts water. Saturate the affected area and allow the acidic vinegar to dissolve the alkaline urine salts. A 10 minute dwell time is usually sufficient.</li>\r\n\t<li>Extract as much as possible with the wet/dry vac. The SOS Sub Surface Extraction tool is helpful (but not necessary) for improving the water recovery.</li>\r\n\t<li>Following the initial extraction, flush with mixture of water and deodorizer, such as Fresh Wave. Flush the area until the recovered water is clear. You may also choose to use enzymes to consume the bacteria remaining after your cleaning attempt, but keep in mind that enzymes are living cultures that kill other living cultures. They can create an odor, can be sudsy, and require time to work effectively (follow manufacturer&rsquo;s directions).&nbsp; We also recommend flushing the area after using the enzyme treatment with a deodorizer.</li>\r\n\t<li>After you feel you have sufficiently flushed out all urine residue and have run your deodorizer of choice through the area, you need to extract as much water as possible. Again, using your wet/dry vacuum and the SOS extraction tool remove water until you feel you cannot remove any more water.</li>\r\n\t<li>After extracting as much as possible, blot the area with a towel to absorb as much surface moisture as you can.</li>\r\n\t<li>If you still notice yellow discoloration on the area, you will need to determine if it is a stain or if there is still urine in the carpet. Do this by smelling the area. If you smell urine, repeat your process as you have yet to remove all of the urine.&nbsp; If you do not have an odor, it is likely your nylon (or wool) carpet has stained. Apply light spray of 3% peroxide (can be diluted to 1.5% to decrease strength, always test for color loss in an inconspicuous area.) to remove yellowing.&nbsp; This stain correction process sometimes produces better results when performed on dry carpet after the cleaning has been completed.&nbsp;(Always test peroxide for color loss in inconspicuous area.)</li>\r\n\t<li>Put a fan on the area to dry quickly. An industrial powered centrifugal air mover is suggested and can sometimes be rented at hardware stores. A ceiling fan, box fan or other home fan can also be used.

Your carpet or rug may&nbsp;be permanently stained. Sometimes the odor will not be removed for various reasons. Cleaning old pet stains&nbsp;from carpet is a salvage attempt and should be taken on after considering the replacement value and the need to stop further contamination and repair structural damage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If all of this sounds like more than you are willing to take on or if you have tried this method but still have a problem, then it may be time to call a professional.

When Clean Matters, It Matters Who Cleans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve all seen the signs on the side of the road around Houston, Humble, Kingwood, and surrounding areas claiming something along the lines of &ldquo;Carpet Cleaning, 3 rooms for $&rdquo;. These offers seem enticing because of the low price, but how can they afford to clean at that almost ridiculously low price? Because they skip steps! The typical cleaning experience with companies like that is that they are cheap, fast, and leave the carpet looking clean&hellip; for about an hour. They sacrifice steps like proper pre-conditioning, extraction, and drying techniques so that they can get in and out of the house quickly so that they can afford to charge so little.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The toll that the customer pays for this is that their carpet re-soils very quickly. This re-soiling occurs because the soap in the carpet never got rinsed all the way out and the carpet is still wet, so any dirt will easily stick to the wet soapy carpet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There have been occasions where we have cleaned up after these companies, one customer even said in a review on our Google that &ldquo;This Company actually cleaned my carpet after another company failed to do it properly&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You might be thinking &ldquo;Why would you care if other carpet cleaners in Houston do poor jobs, that just makes you look better and it gives you more business cleaning up their messes?&rdquo; The reason we care is because companies like that make the entire industry look bad. If someone gets their carpet &ldquo;cleaned&rdquo; by one of these companies, and they leave behind a negative experience for the customer, then the customer will associate getting their carpets cleaned with that negative experience and be apprehensive towards hiring another cleaner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At Decker&rsquo;s Carpet Cleaning, we strive to be the company in Houston you call When Clean Matters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking of quality and trust and low price budget carpet cleaners in Houston, some cleaners will leave a lasting impression after they are gone. Is that impression going to be of a quality carpet cleaner, or a low price carpet cleaner who cuts corners to ensure they can make money on their low price carpet cleaning?<br />\r\nCheap Carpet Cleaners don&rsquo;t always care about quality and often have to take short cuts to make any money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"post4\" src=\"https://www.deckerscarpetcleaning.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/post4-300x253.jpg\" style=\"height:253px; width:300px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this picture you can see the nasty carpet fuzz and hair and debris left on the homeowners&rsquo; lawn. It should have been dumped down the main line clean out located only three feet to the left of where they drained. This is what happens with low budget carpet cleaners in Houston.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, to be honest, there are times when we can&rsquo;t find the main line clean out when cleaning carpets around the Houston area. These times, if we need to drain our waste tank, we filter the debris and then we clean up what is left over. That&rsquo;s what a quality carpet cleaning company should do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You should ask yourself this question&hellip; If a cheap carpet cleaner in Humble will leave this unsightly funk on your lawn for you to clean up and for the entire world to see, what did they leave in your carpet?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Ben Franklin is reported to have said, &ldquo;The bitterness of poor quality remains long after the sweetness of low price is forgotten.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The same standards apply to carpet repair. We don&rsquo;t sacrifice quality for the sake of getting the job done quickly and cheaply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"post5\" src=\"https://www.deckerscarpetcleaning.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/post5-300x253.jpg\" style=\"height:233px; width:276px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s an example we came across of a carpet repair in Humble.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our competition&rsquo;s attempt to DUCT TAPE a bonded insert!We discovered this carpet repair in Humble while cleaning a home for new owners. The carpet patch seemed loose and was raised and starting to curl and shed fibers. We took a look at the carpet patch and found the previous carpet repair person used duct tape to hold it in place. The proper method (that we have been trained to use) would have been to seam seal the edges to prevent shedding and maintain the integrity of the carpet, and to use heat set seam tape to permanently bond the seams on all 4 sides.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We strive to make sure every step of our process is high in quality and in value. Sure we make mistakes, everyone does at some point. But the difference between quality and value, and a low price budget outfit is the lasting effect of the service.</p>", "created_on": "2022-03-28T22:07:47.155Z", "meta_description": "The sad truth about the carpet cleaning industry.

Anti-Allergen Deodorizer is an oxidizing odor counteractant that is perfume free. It uses oxidation to converts odors into odor-free compounds and works on all types of odors. Anti-Allergen Deodorizer is specially formulated for homeowners who are sensitive to perfumes and pesticides. It is environmentally safe and free of pesticides, perfumes, harmful solvents, or other hazardous ingredients. Most importantly, it is effective in controlling the allergens in the home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our Allergy Relief Treatment has been proven effective in denaturing the protein allergens from dust mite droppings, cockroach droppings, dog dander, and cat saliva. Allergy Relief Treatment is a water-based solution that contains a powerful active ingredient derived from naturally occurring extracts found in certain fruit and vegetable seeds. It works by denaturing the structure of the allergen, and thus, substantially reducing the Ige antibody-binding capacity of the allergen. As a result, they are no longer &ldquo;recognized&rdquo; by the body&rsquo;s immune system, alleviating the body&rsquo;s allergic response (allergy attack).

Especially for first time customers, this is a very common and important question.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li style=\"list-style-type:decimal\"><span style=\"color:#ffffff\">PICK UP and remove personal and decorative items that are on the floors we are there to clean prior to our arrival.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#ffffff\">Easily moved items such as plants, boxes, baskets, toys, dog toys beds or chews, clothes &amp; shoes, breakables, fans, electronics, light chairs, and small tables are best moved by you before we arrive so that we can focus on cleaning your floor and you can avoid extra charges.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"2\">\r\n\t<li style=\"list-style-type:decimal\"><span style=\"color:#ffffff\">CLEAR AWAY breakables and personal items from furniture we will be moving.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#ffffff\">We can move A FEW pieces of LIGHT to MEDIUM furniture ( items that can be easily moved by one person) per room at no additional cost, allowing that there is space available to move the items and work safely.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#ffffff\">Items to be moved should be cleared of breakables and personal items before our arrival, and lightened as much as possible. Personal items such as picture frames, lamps, decorative pieces, collectables, toys, books, dishes, or anything of that nature that may make it difficult to move a given piece of furniture safely. Those pieces will be left in place.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe CAN MOVE most of the following:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#ffffff\">Nightstands, end tables, chairs, ottomans, loveseats, some couches, coffee tables, and dining chairs.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#ffffff\">Items moved will be replaced to their approximate location (as close as possible) and set on tabs or blocks to prevent damage. You are responsible for removing blocks and tabs after 24 hours. If you would rather we not place blocks, please let us know. (We can return and remove the blocks and tabs for a small charge. - If you need assistance, please let us know.)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe generally DO NOT move Heavy couches (recliners, etc), Sectionals, Beds, Dressers, Desks, Hutches, Curio Cabinets, Grandfather Clocks, Large Plants, Electronics, Exercise Equipment, Appliances, Antiques, Musical Instruments, Firearms, Gun Safes, Live Animals, or items exceeding 50 pounds.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#ffffff\">For some services, and in some situations, larger or heavier objects DO need to be moved. &nbsp;These will be moved at the Lead Technicians discretion and will be priced ON SITE before work is performed. As with any other item, we ask that it be cleared of breakables and personal items and be made as light as possible. In many cases it makes sense to move or arrange a moving company to handle these items before we arrive.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#ffffff\">We edge around stationary furniture and clean all areas of visible and accessible carpet.</span><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"3\">\r\n\t<li style=\"list-style-type:decimal\"><span style=\"color:#ffffff\">Vacuum - If you have pets or excessive hair, soil, or debris on the carpet, it is best to vacuum prior to our arrival.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#ffffff\">Dry soil and hair removal are THE FOUNDATION of cleaning carpet. We utilize a dual motor, self adjusting, HEPA filtered commercial vacuum. Our goal is to remove the soils deep inside the carpet. Every bit of vacuuming will help.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome homes may take more than the standard amount of dry soil removal and we may charge additional for the extra time involved. &nbsp;Some homes may have a pet dander, hair, and oil odors and we utilize additional efforts before we get the carpet wet to achieve the best results. &nbsp;Some houses have worn in traffic lanes, and lifting the pile before cleaning is in order. Vacuuming before we arrive helps to identify if these are issues we are facing and can help avoid unnecessary extra charges.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"4\">\r\n\t<li style=\"list-style-type:decimal\"><span style=\"color:#ffffff\">Provide Access - We will of course need access to all areas of carpet you would like cleaned. &nbsp;We will also need power, water, and a place to park.</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#ffffff\">We will need clear pathways (about 2 feet wide) to all areas we are cleaning so that we can access the area safely. Usually we begin at the furthest point from the front door and work our way towards the door in waves. Our crew moves through the house in a wave of dry soil removal visiting all areas, followed by an application of cleaning solution and extraction of a couple of rooms at a time. We set fans to speed dry and groom the carpet as we go. We utilize multiple cleaning methods for various soiling conditions and may visit an area multiple times.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe ask that other workers, children, and pets are not walking around in the areas we are working. &nbsp;We can certainly share the space, but we want to avoid muddy boots, slip and fall accidents, barking dogs, and crawling babies as we clean the floor! We strive to create a safe work environment for ourselves and our customers and appreciate your cooperation. If you have any questions about how we share the space and what is appropriate, just give us a call.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"5\">\r\n\t<li style=\"list-style-type:decimal\"><span style=\"color:#ffffff\">Be Ready - For the best experience, have your home ready before we arrive.</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#ffffff\">We try really hard to be on time for all of our customers. &nbsp;We have tight appointment times as opposed to big arrival windows and one way we are able to do this is through the cooperation of our customers. &nbsp;Most customers don&rsquo;t want us in their house all day either! If you take the time to prepare before we arrive, that allows us to maintain that STATE OF FLOW and get the results we all desire and return your home to you sooner. &nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#ffffff\"><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff\">6. Communicate - If you have any questions, special issues or requests, changes, people working in the house at the same time and are worried, kids or pets and not sure if it&#39;s going to be comfortable &nbsp;- just give us a call or email. &nbsp;If anyone in the home is ill, let us know.</span></span></p>", "created_on": "2022-03-28T22:35:25.115Z", "meta_description": "Tips to prepare
