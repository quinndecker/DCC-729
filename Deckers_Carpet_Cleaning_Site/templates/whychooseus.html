          Hi, I'm Mike Decker. My family and I own and operate Decker's Carpet
          Cleaning. When we send our crews to your home, rest assured the carpet
          and upholstery we clean is covered by our Standard 30 Day Warranty.
          <br /><br />
          First, we'll provide you with a complimentary bottle of spotter. If
          any spot returns within 30 Day months from the date of cleaning, we
          will return and retreat the area. If you spill or drop something,
          don't worry, we've got your back. Try the complimentary spotter first,
          but if it doesn't remove, or if it's a larger spot, call us. “One man
          gathers what another man spills.”
        </p>

        <h2>Protect Your Investment in Clean Carpet</h2>
        <p>
          You may also opt for the Upgraded 6 Month Warranty that comes with the
          application of Green Guard, our carpet protector of choice. When we
          apply our environmentally safe carpet protector we will also provide
          you with a complimentary bottle of spot remover. If any spills or
          footprints should occur, attempt to remove it with the spotter. If the
          spot is large, or the spotter does not remove the spill, give us a
          call. <br /><br />
          And if you're feeling particularly protective, perhaps our Stay
          Beautiful Club combined with our Green Guard carpet protection is for
          you. This covers your from your first clean to your mid year carpet
          clean, then back around to your 1 year carpet cleaning. <br /><br />
          <span> Exclusions: </span><br />
          Keep in mind, this isn't for pet urine issues, traffic lanes, worn
          areas, or generally re-soiled carpets. This is for a spill or spot
          cleanup. We do reserve the right to determine a spill vs resoiling,
          and this isn't for whole rooms or traffic lanes.

    <h2>Our Company History</h2>
    <div class="body-columns">
      <div class="col col-text-2">
        <p>
          When we first started out in 2011, we followed prevailing wisdom when
          it came to carpet cleaning technology. We used Hot Water Extraction,
          otherwise known as Steam Cleaning, to clean every carpet. It didn't
          take long for us to realize Houston has some specific conditions that
          do not always cooperate with Hot Water Extraction cleaning. For one,
          it's HUMID here. Dry times were slow, regardless of the GIANT
          machines, big wands with massive airflow, and industrial air movers to
          speed the drying process. <br />
          Another issue is the pollen and plant matter in the Livable Forest of
          Kingwood and other master planned communities like The Woodlands and
          Atacsocita, or the fine soil and sand in more rural and rustic farm
          areas in New Caney or Porter, or the clay soil around Lake Houston and
          Huffman. All these areas respond differently to different treatments
          and they all deposit fine particles deep in the carpet. Particles that
          turn to mud when they get wet. <br />
          We love our dogs here in Texas, too. But many times those dogs (and
          cats, ferrets, rabbits, chinchillas, birds, lizards, horses, chickens,
          and guinea pigs…) come with their own unique set of issues. Combined
          with the humidity, this can offend the nose and even make us sick.
          Many cleaners use deodorizers and enzymes to attempt to mask or digest
          urine issues. Our experience taught us that enzymes have a place, but
          are not the best way to treat urine issues. <br />
          Over time, with research and late night study combined with trial and
          error we had a realization. Many times we fix the Steam Cleaning
          problems with Encapsulation Cleaning, so why not use encapsulation as
          a primary cleaning method? It's generally used in commercial cleaning
          with high traffic and heavy soils, so what stops us from using it for
          residential cleaning? <br />
          Hi My name is Mike Decker. My family and I started Decker's Carpet
          Cleaning back in 2011 because our dogs and cats were making a mess.
          Renting a machine from the grocery or hardware store was affordable,
          but took all day and left the carpets wet, soapy, and not all that
          clean. Not to mention who knows what happened to it before you got it!
          <br />
          We tried the chain services. Wait around for half a day... Crew (of
          one) arrives late, smelly, grumpy and tired... They rush through the
          full house job in an hour or so… door wide open and machine screaming
          in the driveway leaking some kind of smelly fluid, and it costs me a
          few hundred dollars. The carpet dries slowly (duh), and looks … a
          little… better. It still smells like dog and cat pee, but now it
          smells musty too. <br />
          I cleaned carpets for a guy near Chicago back in the early 1990's,
          before my retail days. I learned all the ways to soap up a carpet and
          make it look great, only to rapidly resoil and ensure that 6 month
          repeat call. I learned that most people don't know cheap cleaning
          chemicals from quality cleaning solutions and a company can use cheap
          products that turn the technician's tongue numb and pollute the
          environment in and around the home, but tell the customer they are
          using only the best products and that they are safe. <br />
          I knew at this point my family and I could do better. <br />
          So I left my corporate retail management job, took my 401K, and went
          to work. Quinn and I put flyers on doors, cold called businesses, and
          took any crazy job that came our way, while Lissa handled back office
          tasks and eventually started helping with phones. After school and
          weekends for Quinn, and during the day was me cleaning alone while
          taking phone calls. It was long days and hard work, but we quickly
          grew a following. <br />
          Eventually we grew enough to hire some help. Lissa, my wife, left her
          job and ran the office and phones and we were growing. We've grown a
          bit since then Lissa now has her own business, but handles some back
          office and bookkeeping. Quinn handles phones and is working on an
          expansion plan, while I manage the crews in the field and help with
          phones (I'm a quality control freak and can't let either go!). <br />
          Over the first 7 or 8 years, we've honed our approach to cleaning to
          put our realizations to practice and we have produced our own Science
          Based Proprietary Hybrid Cleaning System for residential carpet
          cleaning. We use a combination of earth friendly and family safe
          Colloidal Micelle Nanoparticle detergent, sodium carbonate based
          cleaning solutions, and odor and soil encapsulating polymers. We
          combine multiple dry soil removal steps, Hot Water Extraction, and
          Pad-Capping or Cotton Bonnet Extraction using a triple action orbital
          and Low Moisture Cleaning Technology.
