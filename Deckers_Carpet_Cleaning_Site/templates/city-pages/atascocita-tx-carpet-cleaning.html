        is a booming blossoming suburb of Houston on the shores of Lake Houston.
        It has a rich and diverse culture that is perfect for people of all ages
        and was named one of the "Best Places To Retire" by US News And World
        Report. Atascocita's educational system is top notch with the award
        winning Atascocita High School at its center. Atascocita is renowned for

        Atascocita was originally named Atascocito. No one is quite sure when
        the name changed. It was named after the Atascocito military outpost and
        Atascocito Road built by the Spanish in 1756. The road connected eastern
        Texas to New Spain. It spanned from San Antonio to Spanish Louisiana.
        Construction in Atascocita started in the 1970s, but really started to
        take off in the 1990s which quickly began to completely transform the
        town.

        Another amazing transformation is what Decker's Carpet Cleaning can do

        Over time, carpets (and floors) become old and worn. Proper daily and
        weekly maintenance can help stave off the effects of wear and tear, but
        it's just a matter of time until those high traffic areas become
        obvious. Too many people have their beloved carpeting ripped up and
        replaced because they don't know what else to do. We take pride in our
        homes, and although we may love our carpeting, we don't love an
        unsightly house.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is where Decker's Carpet Cleaning can save the day. Think of us as
        maintenance that's done on a longer timeline. You vacuum your carpets
        and scrub and mop your floors daily or weekly. We expertly clean and
        restore your carpeting and stone floors when that more regular care just
        isn't cutting it any longer. We breathe new life into your carpeting and
        upholstery which transforms your entire home.
      </p>
      <p>
        We begin our professional carpet cleaning process by working with you
        directly to gain a true understanding of your needs and the areas in
        your home that require special attention. Decker's expert cleaners will
        thoroughly assess your carpeting and discuss all of your options with
        you before starting any physical work. We want you to feel comfortable
        every step of the way. You should feel better from the time we arrive
        and be overjoyed when you see the results.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now let's get technical. Being experts in our field means that we also
        LOVE the opportunity to tell you how we apply what we know to revitalize
        a carpet and a home.

      <p>
        Decker's Carpet Cleaning has three different methods to choose from. We
        offer an improved version of conventional hot water extraction, low
        moisture carpet cleaning and a Hybrid Carpet Cleaning method developed
        by Mike Decker which combines both methods to maximize the benefits of
        both processes.
      </p>
      <h3 class="content-subheaders">

          href="/carpet-cleaning/#low-moisture"
          >Low Moisture Cleaning</a
        >
      </h3>
      <p>
        For light to medium soiled carpets, we have a low moisture cleaning
        process. Like all of our cleaning methods it begins with a 2 step dry
        soil removal process starting with a counter rotating brush to lift the
        pile allowing for maximum soil removal. We then vacuum the carpet with
        our dual motor HEPA filtered vacuum. Removal of dry dirt and soil before
        applying any liquids to the carpet is crucial in achieving a proper
        carpet cleaning, and is just another way we go above and beyond for our
        customers.
      </p>
      <p>
        This process then uses a low moisture encapsulation cleaning solution to
        trap the dirt and stains. The encapsulation fluid is agitated and worked
        into the carpet to trap the highest amount of dirt and soils possible.
        The encapsulation cleaning solution is then removed through the use of
        absorbent cotton bonnets driven by a tri-directional orbital scrubbing
        machine.
      </p>
      <p>
        We use a same day carpet cleaning process that uses 90% less water. That
        translates to a dry time of roughly two hours after cleaning. That's 10
        times faster than most. And a fast dry time is crucial for the long term
        life of your carpets and the floors beneath them.
      </p>

          >Hot Water Extraction Cleaning</a
        >
      </h3>
      <p>
        The Decker's Carpet Cleaning version of conventional hot water
        extraction adds a counter rotating brush at the beginning of the process
        which lifts the pile of the carpet. This raises the fibers. So when we
        then vacuum, we really get deep into the carpet fibers to lift out the
        dry dirt that's caught in the carpeting. We want to pull all the dry
        soil possible before we apply any liquid.
      </p>
      <p>
        We then apply our hypoallergenic non toxic Deep Cleaning Detergent, and
        work in this solution through agitation with carpet rakes, ensuring even
        cleaning and proper scrubbing of the toughest areas. We then rinse the
        carpet using our high powered truck-mounted cleaning unit with an
        emulsifying rinse to leave the carpet soft and free of soapy residue.

          >Hybrid Cleaning - "The Double Decker</a
        >
      </h3>
      <p>
        Our Hybrid Carpet Cleaning process (known as the Double Decker) was
        designed by Mike Decker when he asked himself, "If encapsulation works
        for spot treatment and is the basis for low moisture cleaning. And hot
        water extraction works well for carpets that are more heavily soiled.
        Why not combine the two? Why not use the best and most effective aspects
        of both methods to complement each other? And then he went to work
        creating the Hybrid Carpet Cleaning Process. The Double Decker. There
        are no other carpet cleaners that we're aware of using this method. This
        is an innovation certain to revolutionize the industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Double Decker starts with a two step dry soil removal process
        through the use of a counter rotating brush, followed by a HEPA filtered
        dual motor self adjusting commercial vacuum. This is to ensure as much
        dry soil removal as possible before applying any solutions, avoiding
        turning dry dirt, dust and debris into mud locked in the carpet. Next we
        perform an entire pass of our Hot Water Extraction cleaning, breaking
        through tough traffic lanes and heavily soiled areas. We then apply a
        low moisture cleaning solution designed to encapsulate any remaining
        dirt, soils and spots into a solution that can be removed through the
        use of a triple action orbital floor scrubber and cotton extraction
        bonnets.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we're done with your carpets, they will be clean. Walk on them in
        your bare feet. Let your kids lie on them. They should be that clean,
        shouldn't they? That's the level of clean you should expect from carpet
        cleaning experts. That's the clean that Decker's Carpet Cleaning brings
        you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's talk about cleaning solutions. Our solutions are all natural and
        non-toxic. They are entirely safe for kids and pets. They are also the
        very best carpet cleaning solutions for stains available. Our cleaning
        technology is state of the art. Our commercial carpet cleaning machine
        uses less water. We also get rid of as much of the dry soil first. This
        way we can tackle the toughest stains with far less water used.
      </p>
      <p>
        Traditional cleaning products leave your carpet sticky, usually due to
        excess soap being left behind. Sticky means that it's attracting dirt
        already. Think of it like this, if you have ever been in a hurry in the
        morning and not been able to rinse out all of the shampoo from your
        hair, you notice that your hair is sticky and dirty at the end of the
        day. The same can happen to your carpets with traditional carpet
        cleaning shampoos. Your carpet has just been cleaned and it's already
        attracting dirt. Not with our cleaning solution. Ours is designed to dry
        quickly and residue free leaving your carpets actually clean.

        We spend so much time on our most comfortable furniture. Our favorite

        With spending so much of our lives on our furniture, comes the
        unfortunate downside of accidents and debris associated with it. Food,

        Every one to two years is a good amount of time to have your everyday
        upholstery cleaned if it doesn't need it sooner. That's furniture like

        bought solutions and home cleaning machines can sometimes permanently

        that will flex with the fabric, allowing it to last longer and protect

        Tile seems easy to clean. You spill something and you wipe, sweep or mop
        it right up, but the grout is a different matter. Grout is porous, and
        can house dirt and bacteria. In fact, every time you use a mop or floor
        cleaner, you can push dirt further down into the grout. At some point,
        the dirt gets caked in which accelerates the process. You can see it
        when the grout gets discolored. It'll just get worse and appear stained
        until something is done about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Decker's Carpet Cleaning's team of tile and grout cleaning professionals
        are here to help. Our tile and grout cleaning machine uses heat,
        pressure and a vacuum to pull the dirt out of the grout. It doesn't
        matter how long it's been, our machine will get the jobs done and
        restore your tile floor to leave it looking like new.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our Tile Cleaning process can also extend to the tile and grout of your
        shower walls and glass. We will make your shower and tile walls look
        gorgeous again. Some stains, especially soap scum, hard water deposits
        and mold won't seem to scrub off. We can handle them using safe and
        powerful grout cleaning products which can tackle the worst jobs and
        restore their original beauty. Decker's Carpet Cleaning works with
        residential and commercial clients.

          >Grout Sealing</a
        >
      </h3>
      <p>
        Now that it's clean, it's time for sealant. We recommend cleaning and
        sealing your tile and grout floors appropriately every one to three
        years, with two years being the standard. The specific type of tile and
        grout you have and the use that area gets regularly can vary that
        maintenance schedule considerably.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to keep your floors looking new, regular grout cleaning and
        sealing is essential. Sealing after cleaning will not only keep your
        floor looking like new longer and increase the durability of your grout,
        but it will close the grout's pores. This means that dirt and bacteria
        won't be able to get in there.
      </p>
      <p>
        A clear seal will last 3-5 years (depending on foot traffic). You may
        also opt for a grout recoloring instead of a clear seal. Grout
        recoloring can be done when staining has gone beyond any level of clean
        and into permanent staining, or whenever you feel like it's time for a
        change but do not want to replace all of the tile flooring. A color seal
        can last a decade. We have more than 90 different sealant color choices
        for grout recoloring.
      </p>
      <p>
        Decker's Carpet Cleaning will, as always, examine and determine the best
        course of action to clean and restore your tile and grout floors and

        Granite is tough, strong and beautiful. That's why it's such a great
        choice of material for countertops. As tough as granite is, it can be
        damaged by hard water, acidic or abrasive cleaning products and
        excessive cold or heat. Decker's Carpet Cleaning has experts who know
        granite cleaning and restoration. Our technicians will deep clean,
        polish and restore your granite countertop to a scratch free, bright and
        shiny appearance. As with tile, it is recommended that the granite
        countertops are sealed to protect them from future damage.

        Decker's Carpet Cleaning is staffed with expert technicians who
        understand how to care for natural stone floors. Stone is natural and
        durable and has such longevity, but to keep your stone floors looking
        lustrous requires regular cleaning and maintenance. Stone Floors are
        porous, meaning they can take in dirt and liquids which can stain or
        discolor the stone. Stone floors are generally susceptible to scratches,
        dulling and breaks. We can keep your stone floors looking like new with
        deep cleaning and restoration as well as ongoing maintenance. We can
        hone and polish to emphasize your floor's natural beauty. And we can
        seal it to protect your stone in the future.
