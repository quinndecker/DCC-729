        Being a small, owner-operated carpet cleaning company living and working
        in Kingwood, we have gotten to know the unique soil conditions relevant
        to the area such as the pollen, as well as conditions like humidity that
        can make carpet cleaning in the area more difficult. We have learned
        this through not only operating in the area for over a decade, but also
        through our own experiences living in Kingwood for even longer than
        that. Through these experiences, we have formulated the most effective
        carpet cleaning method to deal with these issues that no other local
        <a href="https://g.page/r/CV4Ndu9glPmfEAE" class="whitelinks"
          >Carpet Cleaner in Kingwood</a
        >
        can replicate.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are the only carpet cleaning company in Kingwood that employs a
        hybrid of two different methods of carpet cleaning. We use a hybrid
        method of low-moisture encapsulation cleaning and truck mounted hot
        water extraction cleaning for more heavily soiled areas. We have figured
        out the strengths and benefits of each method and when to use which
        method to leave your carpets looking, feeling and smelling amazing.

          >Low Moisture Cleaning</a
        >
      </h3>
      <p>
        At Decker's Carpet Cleaning, we employ the most advanced method of low
        moisture cleaning currently available. For standard cleaning situations
        we use a Very Low Moisture system that stays cleaner longer, leaves your
        carpet dry in an hour or two, and your door closed through most of the
        cleaning process. First, we prepare the carpet using a 2 step dry soil
        removal process including counter rotating brushes to pull out dry soil
        and hair prep the carpet for a detailed vacuuming with our HEPA filtered
        vacuums. Next we apply our biodegradable cleaning solution to dislodge
        sticky substances and encapsulate remaining soils. We then agitate and
        extract the moisture and soils using cotton bonnets and the safest and
        most thorough agitation machine available. We follow the cleaning with
        by speed drying utilizing high powered air movers, and then groom the
        carpet for a final set of the fibers and finished look.
      </p>

          >Hot Water Extraction Cleaning</a
        >
      </h3>
      <p>
        In addition to our Very Low Moisture carpet cleaning system, we also
        offer a truck mounted Hot Water Extraction cleaning method. In certain
        situations, this process is more effective for removing large amounts of
        soil very quickly. This process begins the same way as a low moisture
        cleaning where we employ our 2 step dry soil removal process using
        counter rotating brushes and HEPA filtered Vacuums. We then pre treat
        the carpet with a high powered soapless cleaning solution designed to
        separate dirt and soils from your carpet and rinse completely free of
        residue, unlike a carpet shampoo. Once the cleaning solution has been
        applied to the carpet, we hand agitate the solution for deeper
        penetration into the carpet, and rinse the cleaning solution out of the
        carpet using our truck mounted extraction machine.

          >Hybrid Cleaning - "The Double Decker</a
        >
      </h3>
      <p>
        Our Hybrid Carpet Cleaning process (known as the Double Decker) was
        designed by Mike Decker when he asked himself, "If encapsulation works
        for spot treatment and is the basis for low moisture cleaning. And hot
        water extraction works well for carpets that are more heavily soiled.
        Why not combine the two? Why not use the best and most effective aspects
        of both methods to complement each other? And then he went to work
        creating the Hybrid Carpet Cleaning Process. The Double Decker. There
        are no other carpet cleaners that we're aware of using this method. This
        is an innovation certain to revolutionize the industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Double Decker starts with a two step dry soil removal process
        through the use of a counter rotating brush, followed by a HEPA filtered
        dual motor self adjusting commercial vacuum. This is to ensure as much
        dry soil removal as possible before applying any solutions, avoiding
        turning dry dirt, dust and debris into mud locked in the carpet. Next we
        perform an entire pass of our Hot Water Extraction cleaning, breaking
        through tough traffic lanes and heavily soiled areas. We then apply a
        low moisture cleaning solution designed to encapsulate any remaining
        dirt, soils and spots into a solution that can be removed through the
        use of a triple action orbital floor scrubber and cotton extraction
        bonnets.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we're done with your carpets, they will be clean. Walk on them in
        your bare feet. Let your kids lie on them. They should be that clean,
        shouldn't they? That's the level of clean you should expect from carpet
        cleaning experts. That's the clean that Decker's Carpet Cleaning brings
        you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's talk about cleaning solutions. Our solutions are all natural and
        non-toxic. They are entirely safe for kids and pets. They are also the
        very best carpet cleaning solutions for stains available. Our cleaning
        technology is state of the art. Our commercial carpet cleaning machine
        uses less water. We also get rid of as much of the dry soil first. This
        way we can tackle the toughest stains with far less water used.
      </p>
      <p>
        Traditional cleaning products leave your carpet sticky, usually due to
        excess soap being left behind. Sticky means that it's attracting dirt
        already. Think of it like this, if you have ever been in a hurry in the
        morning and not been able to rinse out all of the shampoo from your
        hair, you notice that your hair is sticky and dirty at the end of the
        day. The same can happen to your carpets with traditional carpet
        cleaning shampoos. Your carpet has just been cleaned and it's already
        attracting dirt. Not with our cleaning solution. Ours is designed to dry
        quickly and residue free leaving your carpets actually clean.

        When it comes to choosing a carpet cleaner in Kingwood, it is important
        to look for a company that is familiar with the specific needs of the
        area. Living in the Livable Forest, while it is beautiful, can have some
        adverse effects on your carpet. The large influx of pollen in the area
        can lead to more dirt and debris being tracked onto the floor than usual
        causing traffic lanes, or dark patches of carpet that form in the
        heaviest trafficked areas of the house. You can read more about traffic
        lanes

        You may be asking yourself if hiring a Carpet Cleaner is worth it.
        Cleaning your carpets yourself can be less beneficial than hiring a
        professional Carpet Cleaner in Kingwood.

        The thing most people think of when they think of cleaning their carpets
        themselves at home is going to the grocery store and picking up a rental
        machine to do it themselves. At Decker's Carpet Cleaning, we highly
        advise the residents of Kingwood against this method. The main reason
        being that they tend to leave large amounts of soap deposits in the
        carpet, leaving them very sticky and this allows them to become dirty
        much faster. The reason for this is that these machines use a
        shampoo-style cleaning agent. The way a shampoo works is it is very
        sticky by nature, so dirt and soils and spots and spills in your carpet
        are attracted to the shampoo and stick to it. The problem is, however,
        that these machines are not designed in a way where all of the shampoo
        gets rinsed out of the carpet, leaving a sticky residue on your carpet.
        Rental machines also leave your carpet wet for long periods of time,
        leaving your carpet susceptible to returning spots, mold, mildew, and
        other issues. Our cleaning solutions rinse completely free of any sticky
        residue.
