        Maybe your carpet is getting old, has stains and other wear-and-tear
        over years of use, especially in high-traffic areas. Sometimes people
        give up and choose to rip it up and replace it when their carpet is
        looking ragged or worn out. But replacing carpeting can be expensive and
        it's not always necessary. Decker's Carpet Cleaning has been helping
        clients rejuvenate their carpet for years across The Woodlands region.
        We have the carpet cleaning solution no matter what the problem is. We
        understand that homes are lived in. That children, pets and even adults
        can wreak havoc on carpet. We also understand that homeowners take pride
        in their homes and everyone wants beautiful carpet and floors. We can
        help. Our professional carpet cleaning regimen includes working
        one-on-one with our clients to discuss the home's problem areas. Our
        expert cleaners will evaluate your floors and discuss your options prior
        to beginning any work. Our primary goal at Decker's Carpet Cleaning is
        our customer's satisfaction. Not only do we want our customers to be
        happy with the outcome, we strive to make the process run as smoothly as
        possible. Our same day carpet cleaning process uses nearly 90% less
        water than traditional carpet cleaning methods. That means your carpet
        will dry 10-times faster, usually within about two hours after the
        cleaning. The combination of the counter rotating brush machine, the
        HEPA filtered dual motor self adjusting commercial vacuum, the triple
        action orbital floor scrubber, the cotton extraction bonnets, and the
        cleaning solutions help eliminate returning spots. With traditional
        cleaning, spots can often resurface because the carpet is soaked all the
        way to its base. The top carpet fibers dry first due to airflow and
        evaporation. Because the top is dry and the bottom is still wet, soil
        and moisture are carried to the top. Because we use a low moisture, fast
        drying carpet cleaning solution, this problem is typically eliminated.
        This process also allows our customers to keep their doors closed in
        most cases, which keeps the home's temperature and humidity consistent,
        and it's safer for children and pets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because the team at Decker's Carpet Cleaning takes pride in their work,
        we use the best carpet cleaning solutions for stains on the market,
        which means our customer's carpet stays cleaner longer than someone who
        uses the traditional carpet cleaning products. We use the highest
        quality and most up-to-date cleaning technology to ensure we remove as
        much dry soil as possible before the carpet gets wet. Our commercial
        carpet cleaner machine also uses less water, which reduces the amount of
        cleaning agent needed - even on the toughest of stains. Traditional
        cleaning products can leave a sticky residue on carpet that makes it
        prone to soiling. Our cleaning solution removes this residue.

        Before you decide to replace your carpet, contact us today to see what
        we can do to help. Our first-rate carpet cleaning process could save you
        thousands of dollars in the long run. We will do a thorough evaluation
        of your carpet and give you an exact quote before we start work. We
        specialize in odor elimination, utilizing all-natural and non-toxic
        ingredients so it's safe for children and pets. Have pets? Don't worry.

        Sometimes carpet can be damaged due to wear and tear from children,
        pets, and standard use over the years. Carpet may become loose and bunch
        up, causing tripping hazards and an unsightly appearance. Whatever your
        need, our trained technicians will give special attention to your floors
        and can repair a vast array of issues. Before you decide to rip up your
        carpet, give us a call. We can evaluate your problem areas and determine
        if it's possible to repair your flooring rather than replace it.

        High traffic areas, heavy furniture, improper installation, or
        environmental issues can all cause ripples, creases, or wrinkles in your
        carpet. Our expert technicians can stretch your carpet back into place,
        remove the ripples and creases, and restore your carpet. This will
        extend the life of your carpet. We can also patch torn, burned or
        damaged carpet areas with bonded inserts.

        Furniture often gets overlooked when it comes to deep cleaning, but it
        shouldn't. Families spend a lot of time on couches and chairs, which can
        collect dust mites, hair, pet dander, cigarette smoke, food and more.
        Decker's Carpet Cleaning offers upholstery and mattress cleaning
        services, including advanced stain removal and fabric protection to
        extend the life of your furniture and help you maintain it between
        cleanings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everyday upholstery such as couches, chairs and mattresses should be
        cleaned every one-to-two years, or as needed when it's soiled. Did you
        know that spot cleaning can end up leaving water marks or even permanent
        damage? Before you try to spot clean your furniture, give us a call. We
        can offer you advice or come out to clean and treat your upholstery, as
        well as a fast drying

        that will flex with the fabric, allowing it to last longer and protect
        it better and longer. Protectors will form a barrier to slow the
        absorption of water and oil based spills, and will also allow for easier
        future soil removal, as the soil will not lodge as deep in the fiber. We
        also offer dye blockers for natural fibers and nylon.

        Tile is fairly simple to clean, and spills and other accidents are
        easily wiped up with a broom or a mop. But did you know that without
        proper up-keep, the grout between your tile is porous and can harbor
        dirt, mold, mildew and bacteria? While mopping your floor does remove
        some of the dirt and bacteria, damp soil can actually soak deeper into
        the grout and any unrinsed residue can cause your floor to appear
        discolored or stained.

      <p>
        Decker's Carpet Cleaning has a team of tile and grout cleaning
        professionals who utilize tried and true methods to ensure your tile and
        grout are truly clean. Our tile and grout cleaning machine uses heat,
        pressure, and a vacuum to pull deep soil to the surface - no matter how
        long you've put off a professional cleaning. We also use a wall tile
        cleaning machine to achieve beautifully clean walls and showers.
        Sometimes certain spills or situations require an aggressive approach.
        We can help. Decker's Carpet Cleaning experts work with both residential
        and commercial clients. We use safe and effective grout cleaning
        chemicals for even the toughest of jobs.

        We recommend cleaning and sealing your tile and grout floors
        approximately every one to three years, with about every two years being
        the standard. Depending on the type of tile and grout you have in your
        home, there are different levels of maintenance required, so it varies
        from home to home. The amount of foot traffic you have in a tile room
        and whether you have children or pets can also mean a floor requires
        maintenance and cleaning more frequently.
      </p>
      <p>
        To keep your floors looking like new, grout cleaning and sealing is a
        crucial part of maintenance. After we professionally clean your tile
        floors and grout, we can seal them. We recommend sealing because it will
        preserve the appearance and extend the life of the grout. Doing this
        between your professional cleanings will help your floors withstand more
        wear and tear while keeping them looking shiny and new. The seal will
        also protect your floors from stains and close the pores of the grout to
        protect it from both liquid and solid dirt and bacteria.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may be asking yourself "does professional tile and grout cleaning
        work?"" Over time, if you're not regularly having your tile floors and
        grout cleaned by a professional, dirt can become caked in the grout,
        seeping deeper into the grout's pores every time you use a mop or liquid
        cleaner. The deeper the soil permeates, the harder it will be to clean
        it. No matter how hard you scrub, you won't be able to clean or remove
        the dirt by hand. We have proven methods to lift stains that no amount
        of scrubbing can fix. Putting off professional cleanings can also cause
        the grout to become discolored. We offer both clear and colored seals,
        with more than 90 different color choices to choose from. A clear seal
        will last about 3-5 years, depending on the foot traffic of your floors,
        while a colored seal can last up to 10 years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Decker's Carpet Cleaning has been helping homeowners and businesses in
        The Woodlands region keep their tile and grout floors looking like new.
        During your appointment our professional tile and grout cleaners will
        evaluate your floors and discuss the best option to both clean and help
        you maintain your tile and grout. We will give you a quote and agree on
        a price before we start any work. Our floor cleaning methods are always
        in accordance with industry standards proven to extend the life of your
        tile and grout, and leaving it clean, spotless and sparkling. Our deep
        cleaning methods can help restore your tile and grout to its original
        color and our sealants will help guard against future stains.

        Because stone is a natural product, it has a long life span, but to keep
        your stone floor's natural beauty, routine cleaning and maintenance is a
        must. Stone floors often are porous, which means they can absorb spills,
        liquid, and soil that can leave them discolored or stained. They also
        scratch easily, may become dull, or even broken or damaged. We can
        provide deep, restorative cleaning and ongoing maintenance for your
        natural stone floors that keep them looking new. We provide honing and
        polishing to help bring out your stone's natural colors. We can also
        seal the stone to protect it from future spills.

        Granite is a popular choice for countertops because of its beauty,
        longevity, and durability. Granite is dense, but it can be damaged from
        things like abrasive or acidic cleaning products, hard water, and
        extreme heat or cold. Decker's Carpet Cleaning has expert technicians
        who specialize in cleaning and restoring granite countertops. We can
