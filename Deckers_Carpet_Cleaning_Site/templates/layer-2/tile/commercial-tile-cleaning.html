        Tile floors are a popular choice for businesses and office buildings as
        it is sleek, professional and easy to maintain relative to carpet.
        However, over time tile floors will begin to build up dirt, grime,
        bacteria, and other contaminants that not only cause the floor to look
        dirty, but also can cause an unsanitary or even unsafe work environment.
        Keeping clean and well maintained tile floors is important for promoting
        a safe, healthy and productive work environment.

        All of our tile cleaning packages begin with a thorough evaluation of
        the tile to be cleaned. Your floor will be evaluated for installation
        and wear issues that may prevent us from safely cleaning the tile. We
        will look for loose or hollow tiles, cracks, missing or damaged grout,
        and properly caulked edges. Sometimes, it just isn't safe to clean a
        floor, and we've told more than one customer to just hold off until it
        can be replaced. <br />After our inspection your floor will be swept of
        the dry soil with a broom or vacuum. Surrounding areas will be protected
        with corner guards, drop cloths, painters tape, and /or plastic
        sheeting. <br />Once the area is prepared and the floor cleaning
        machines set up and ready, your floor will receive an alkaline cleaning
        solution, carefully mopped on to properly cover every inch of tile and
        grout without splashing appliances and wood floors. Every detail is
        attended to as your floor is detail scrubbed using hand tools along the
        edges and corners. The tile surface and grout lines will be scrubbed
        using special grout cleaning hand brushes and counter rotating brushes
        to ensure all areas are thoroughly and evenly cleaned. <br />Once the
        soil has been released and suspended, your floor will be rinsed using
        our high powered truck mounted tile cleaning machine, utilizing up to
        1200 psi of water pressure and water temperatures above 212 degrees. We
        work in small batch areas to be sure we properly rinse the tile of soap
        and soil residue, often overlapping multiple times to be sure nothing is
        missed. <br />As we move through the space cleaning the tile and grout,
        we will place industrial air movers on the clean tile to speed the
        drying process. Once the floor is dry, it will be inspected once again
        to make sure the results we hoped for were achieved.

        There are times when a floor cannot be fully cleaned using only this one
        step process. Has it been more than a few years since your last
        professional cleaning? Does your floor have heavy soap residue or other
        deep penetrating soils? Is there a topical sealer or wax on your floor
        that needs to be removed? In those cases we offer a two step, or
        sometimes (rarely) a 3 step or more cleaning process.

  <h2 class="content-tagline">Tile Cleaning FAQ</h2>
  <div class="breaker"></div>
  <br />
  <h3 class="whitetext">
    Why should I professionally clean my businesses tile floor?
  </h3>
  <p class="whitetext">
    The grout in your tile floor is porous and holds dirt, grime, oil, soil,
    bacteria, and all sorts of gross stuff. Mopping your floor helps to remove
    some of the surface soil, but also allows wet soil to soak deeper into the
    grout. Any un-rinsed residue can attract soil and quickly cause your floor
    to appear stained. Contaminants penetrate deep down into your grout. We are
    able to use various cleaning solutions and methods including heat, pressure,
    and vacuum to pull deep soils away and leave you with beautiful floors. Many
    times we are able to remove years of soil. In some situations, such as
    kitchens, it is important to have a regularly professionally cleaned tile
    floor as the buildup of grease and other residues can cause an unsafe
    environment and slip hazard.
  </p>
  <br />
  <h3 class="whitetext">
    How often should I professionally clean my tile floors?
  </h3>
  <p class="whitetext">
    We recommend cleaning and sealing your tile and grout floors every one to
    three years, with every year being best to maintain the floor long term.
    Different floors require different actual levels of professional
    maintenance.
  </p>
  <br />
  <h3 class="whitetext">Should I seal my tile floors?</h3>
  <p class="whitetext">
    Yes, proper professional sealing of your grout will prevent slow penetration
    of oil and water based stains. The sealer will not stop your floor from
    getting dirty, but it will help to prevent stains and make your mopping and
    each professional cleaning easier. Most sealers are rated to last a few
    years, and with a good professional maintenance plan, can keep your floors
    looking new indefinitely. You can read more about our
    <a class="whitelinks" href="/grout-sealing/">Grout Sealing Services</a>
    here.
  </p>
  <br />
  <h3 class="whitetext">What should I use to clean my tile floors myself?</h3>
  <p class="whitetext">
    We recommend a neutral pH floor cleaning for your regular maintenance. A
    neutral pH floor cleaner will be easy to use, requires minimal rinsing, and
    will decrease the frequency you will need professional cleaning.
  </p>
  <br />
  <h3 class="whitetext">What should I NOT use on my tile floors?</h3>
  <p class="whitetext">
    Using alkaline soaps, or soaps with oils in them will leave a residue that
    will attract soil. This dirt magnet will soak into your grout lines every
    time you mop, making future cleaning more difficult and more expensive.
    Alkaline soaps can be used, on occasion, with LOTS of rinsing, if the floor
    REALLY needs it.
    <br />
    Never use a product with wax, or a product that promises any sort of SHINE.
    This is a topical coating. Never seal your floor with any topical sealer or
    coating. It will fail and need to be removed with harsh strippers in a
    tedious and expensive process.
