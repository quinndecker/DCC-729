        Whether you are looking to revitalize old, stained grout lines or change
        the color of your grout lines, Grout Recoloring and Color Sealing
        services from Decker's Carpet Cleaning is a great choice! Sometimes, due
        to the fact that grout is a porous substance, stains and soils can
        penetrate enough to the point where no amount of cleaning can resolve
        the issue. In these scenarios, we recommend a Color Seal, otherwise
        known as Grout Recoloring.
      </p>
      <h3 class="content-subheaders">How it Works:</h3>
      <p>
        Grout recoloring works by carefully applying a topical sealer over just
        the grout lines in your tile or stone floor. This sealer will not only
        change the color of the grout lines to the desired color, but also work
        as a standard grout sealer, protecting your grout lines from permanent
        staining and soils. You can match the original color of the grout, or
        choose an entirely different color from standard whites, greys, and
        tans, or even pink or purple grout!
      </p>
      <p>
        It is important to keep in mind that your tile floors must be freshly
        cleaned, or newly installed to apply Grout Recoloring Sealer. This is to
        ensure proper application of the sealer, and to make sure no soils are
        sealed in to the grout lines. If you are looking for a Tile Cleaning and
