        Keeping your tile floors clean over the years, and preserving that
        freshly cleaned look can be a struggle. Mopping and sweeping the floors
        can help, but over time the grout lines will begin to hold soils again
        and will tend to look dirty over time. Even after a thorough
        <a class="whitelinks" target="_blank" href="/tile-and-grout-cleaning"
          >Tile Cleaning</a
        >, the grout lines are left porous and unprotected to future soiling.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is why, at Decker's Carpet Cleaning, we recommend following every
        tile and grout cleaning with professional grout sealing. Having your
        grout professionally cleaned and sealed every 3-5 years is not only a
        great long term solution to protect your investment in your tile floors,
        but also a great way to help keep your tile looking good between
        cleanings.
      </p>

        It is important to keep in mind that your tile floors must be freshly
        cleaned, or newly installed to apply a grout sealer. This is to ensure
        proper application of the sealer, and to make sure no soils are sealed
        in to the grout lines. If you are looking for a Tile Cleaning and
        sealing, you can read more about that on our

        Sealing the grout lines after a tile cleaning is something that many
        people can overlook, or think is an unnecessary expense. This could not
        be further from the truth. It is not only better for the long term
        integrity of the floors, but can end up saving you money!
      </p>
      <h3 class="whitetext">How It Works:</h3>
      <p>
        Grout is porous. This means that over time, it will hold dirt, grime,
        oil, soil, bacteria and all sorts of other gross stuff. Mopping the
        floor helps remove some of the surface soils, but allows wet soils to
        sink deeper into the grout lines. Any un-rinsed residue can attract
        soils and quickly cause the floor to appear stained.
      </p>
      <p>
        Grout Sealer works by, essentially, making the grout lines less porous
        and stopping the penetration of dirt and soils into the grout lines.
        This makes it easier to mop up soils and spills, and helps yield better
        results with each professional cleaning. This process is done through
        the use of a clear, invisible sealer applied to the grout lines. In some
        cases, we may recommend a
        <a class="whitelinks" target="_blank" href="/grout-recoloring/"
          >Grout Recoloring</a
        >, aslo known as a color seal for more heavily soiled or permanently
        stained grout lines.

        When looking to protect your tile floors, there are a lot of options
        available. We use
        <a
          class="whitelinks"
          target="_blank"
          href="https://www.saigers.com/tile-and-carpet-cleaners/saigers-sauce-products/saigers-super-sealer-4-gallons"
          >Saiger's Super Sealer</a
        >, a solvent-based protector with flourinated-polymer technology that
        does not affect the appearance or feel of your tile or grout. This
        sealer is clear and invisible, and is carefully applied to only the
        grout lines of your tile floors. This is because it is not necessary to
        seal the tiles themselves as they are not porous. This goes for ceramic
        and porcelain tiles. If you have travertine, or other natural stone tile
        floors, you can read more about
        <a class="whitelinks" target="_blank" href="/stone-floor-cleaning/"
          >cleaning</a

        In contrast, there are many products you can buy in stores that use a
        different method to seal the tile and grout. Many of these sealers ,
        which we refer to as "topical sealers" merely coat the tile and grout in
        a waxy substance that forms a barrier between the tile and the outside
        world. This method does give the tiles a certain "shine" to them,
        however they are damaging to the integrity of your tile floors. Over
        time, the dirt and soils will collect in the wax causing the appearance
        of stained grout lines and dirty tiles. This wax can begin to flake up
        through the traffic patterns of the house, leaving your tile floors
        looking patchy with dirt and soils. The wax cannot be removed through a
        standard tile cleaning and in many cases must be removed with a wax
        stripper before cleaning can begin. We do not recommend the use of
        topical sealers applied by yourself or by another tile cleaner for
        ceramic, porcelain, travertine, marble or any natural stone tiles.
