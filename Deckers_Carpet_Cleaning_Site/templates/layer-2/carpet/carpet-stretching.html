        Ask anyone with a carpet in their home, and they will tell you that it
        is a timeless flooring option that elevates the style of any room it's
        placed in. Carpets indeed make rooms look comfortable and inviting.
        However, the biggest problem with carpets is that heavy traffic and
        furniture moving can cause ghastly ripples and waves in your carpet over
        time. <br /><br />
        Not only do these unsightly waves and wrinkles in your carpet look bad,
        but they are also a tripping hazard in your home. Your carpet can also
        get waves and wrinkles due to improper installation or damage. In most
        cases, the carpet is not stretched properly. Replacing your carpet with
        a new one in this condition is unnecessary and can be expensive.
        <br /><br />
        The good news is that there is a simple and cost-effective way to
        restore your carpets to their original condition that doesn't involve
        replacing or cleaning them. The process is known as carpet stretching,
        and it helps extend your carpet's life, adding life back to them when
        they start looking dull.

        You may have noticed that your carpet has gotten loose over time, and
        bubbles and ripples are appearing in different spots. It's something
        that won't go away, and in most cases, will only get worse, becoming a
        tripping hazard in your room. <br /><br />
        Those who haven't heard the phrase "carpet stretching" should know that
        it's a simple process in which the repair professionals pull the carpet
        tighter to the room's edges and re-secure it to the anchor or tack
        strips. Carpet stretching ensures the wrinkled carpet is smooth. The
        re-stretching ensures it goes back to its original shape, minimizing
        safety concerns and adding to your room's overall aesthetic appeal.

          We use a carpet power stretcher to stretch out the ripples and use a

          We disengage two sides of the room and stretch the wrinkles out. The
          carpet is then trimmed and reattached. Rooms generally should be
          cleared of furniture to stretch the whole room.
