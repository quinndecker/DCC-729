        Nothing beats the feeling and smell of a carpet that has been freshly
        cleaned. Your home will be more enjoyable when you have odor-free, clean
        carpets that look brand new. Unfortunately, most freshly cleaned carpets
        won't stay in that condition for long. Sometimes, the opposite happens,
        as your clean and fresh carpet is more likely to get ruined or dirty by
        an accidental spill.

        At Decker's Carpet Cleaning, we provide you with the perfect way to
        preserve your clean and fresh carpets for years. By applying

        Decker's Carpet Cleaning's carpet protectors can be added to your carpet
        cleaning service whenever you desire. That will create an invisible
        shield around the fibers of your upholstery or carpet, which will allow
        them to repel dirt effectively. You won't need to worry about staining
        your carpets after having them cleaned and looking fresh with Green
        Guard.

        spills on your carpet is less likely to leave a stain and will be easier
        to clean as well. We believe that carpet protectors are worth every
        penny, especially if you're interested in extending your carpet's
        lifespan.

    Why Do You Need Carpet Protectors like Green Guard?

        Most people don't believe in buying carpet protectors as they feel it is
        an unnecessary expense. There's nothing wrong with that, except for one
        small issue; when you leave your freshly cleaned carpet unprotected,
        it's more vulnerable to spills, dirt, accidents, and pet issues. An
        unprotected carpet will absorb all the spills and dirt directly into the
        fibers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the course of time between cleanings, the dirt and soils that
        accumulate can actually cause abrasion and distortion of the carpet
        fibers. This is generally the cause of dark traffic lanes in your most
        heavily walked on areas, as the pressure from walking grinding against
        the dirt and soils in the carpet cause fiber distortion. Carpet
        protectors will form a protective layer around the carpet fibers,
        leaving them resistant to physical damage such as abrasion and
        distortion, helping you keep your carpets looking fresh for years.
