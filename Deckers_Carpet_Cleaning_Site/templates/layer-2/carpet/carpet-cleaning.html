        Most people don't realize just how dirty their carpet (and upholstery)
        really is. They think that if it looks clean, then it is clean.
        Unfortunately, this is very deceptive thinking. The reality is that what
        we see is just the surface of our carpet, and there is a lot more going
        on beneath that surface. Most people think they can keep their carpets
        clean by regular vacuuming alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, even though vacuuming does keep your carpets clean, it leaves
        behind a large portion of unpleasant and potentially harmful substances
        in your carpets. If left unchecked, your health and the health of your
        loved ones in the house will eventually be adversely affected. So, even
        if you vacuum your carpets every day, you wouldn't be able to remove
        everything that ends up in them.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's why experts recommend a professional carpet cleaning once every
        year. Our professional carpet cleaning services include low moisture
        standard cleaning for low soil situations, hot water extraction, aka
        steam cleaning. When your carpet is heavily soiled, we recommend our
        Double Decker package, which involves a deep clean followed by a
        standard clean. Learn more about them below.

  <h2 class="content-subheaders">How We Clean Carpet</h2>
  <div class="breaker-2"></div>
  <div class="body-columns">
    <div class="col col-text-2">
      <p>
        All of our carpet cleaning packages begin with a 3 step dry soil removal
        process. First we pile lift and comb out hair and debris. This step
        opens up the fibers to allow our dual motor self adjusting HEPA filtered
        commercial vacuum to be more productive. After a slow and thorough
        vacuuming, we detail the edges and corners.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our base clean is the Standard Clean, which is a low moisture carpet
        cleaning method using soil emulsifying and encapsulating agents which
        are agitated and extracted using cotton bonnets. It's a bit like a giant
        cotton towel blotting your carpet clean using a three directional carpet
        scrubbing machine. The benefits to this system are that your door stays
        closed during the cleaning process, your carpets dry within 2 or 3
        hours, and there is much less chance of returning spots.
      </p>
      <p>
        For heavier soiled carpets we use Hot Water Extraction, traditionally
        known as steam cleaning. The benefits of hot water extraction are heat
        to accelerate the cleaning agent and the water/vacuum flushing action to
        quickly remove bulk soil. This is the traditional truck mounted cleaning
        you've probably seen before
      </p>
      <p>
        We find that following a Hot Water Extraction cleaning with a low
        moisture encapsulation cleaning provides all of the benefits of each
        style of cleaning while negating many of the negative drawbacks. We
        offer the Double Decker for situations where we feel the carpet needs a
        quality cleaning utilizing the benefits of both systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        The material of the carpet and the nature of the soiling are also
        factors in determining the proper cleaning method. In any case, our
        experienced technicians will perform a thorough inspection, including
        determining the fiber type to determine the proper course of action and
        help make the best decision for your home.

    Why Our Detailed Cleaning Methods Perform Better than Any Other Carpet
    Cleaning Method - and are Better for the Environment
  </h3>
  <div class="breaker"></div>
  <div class="body-columns">
    <div class="col col-text-2">
      <p>
        Since we started cleaning carpet in 2011, Decker's Carpet Cleaning has
        been on a quest to simplify the process for our customers and provide
        the best result possible. We have developed a better way to clean
        carpets through study, testing, adjusting, and surveying. Our primary
        goal was to eliminate, or at least reduce, the hassle our customer is
        faced with within a typical appointment - like the door being open and
        long dry times
      </p>
      <p>
        Our secondary goal was to reduce the impact our process has on our
        environment. After all, what good is a carpet cleaner if they create one
        mess by cleaning up another? Clean doesn't stop at your door. Our
        standard process uses approximately 90% less water than traditional
        carpet cleaning, allowing the carpet to dry 10 times faster. Carpets
        generally dry about an hour after we finish.
      </p>

      <h4 class="whitetext">
        Our Low Moisture Cleaning Process Keeps Your Doors Closed During
        Cleaning
      </h4>
      <p>
        Your home will maintain its temperature and humidity. We also ensure
        your pets are safer, your home is more secure, and there's less chance
        of pests flying in. That's what makes us one of the best in the business
        regarding carpet cleaning services.
      </p>
      <h4 class="whitetext">Our Process Reduces Noise and Air Pollution</h4>
      <p>
        By reducing our use of the truck mount, we save 1.5 gallons of gasoline
        per truck per production hour. That's a lot quieter in your driveway,
        with a lot less exhaust odor and fumes in the air around your home. By
        reducing our use of gas-powered cleaning units, we can stop thousands of
        pounds of carbon dioxide from entering your airspace per year per truck!
      </p>
      <h4 class="whitetext">Our Process Nearly Eliminates Returning Spots</h4>
      <p>
        Carpet spots return because of capillary action. The carpet gets wet
        down to the backing with traditional cleaning. Then, the top of the
        fibers dries first due to airflow and evaporation. As the tops dry and
        the bottoms stay damp, soil and moisture are carried up to the driest
        point, the top. Our low moisture fast drying system nearly eliminates
        this issue. In fact, this is the process used to fix that very issue
        with traditional steam cleaning.
      </p>
      <h4 class="whitetext">Our Process Stays Cleaner Longer</h4>
      <p>
        Using the most up-to-date cleaning technology, we can remove more dry
        soil before getting the carpet wet and remove the soil using less water,
        reducing the amount of cleaning agents needed. Traditional cleaning
        solutions can leave a residue that might be sticky, causing rapid
        re-soiling.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our cleaning solution emulsifies and removes this residue, and if left
        behind, will continue to clean over the next couple of vacuum cycles.
        Our low moisture cleaning agents are enhanced with AFT, a new textile
        protector that leaves the material with a positive charge that resists
        oily binders attaching to the fiber.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <h4 class="whitetext">Have we done away with the big truck-mounted units?</h4>
  <div class="body-columns">
    <div class="col-text-2">
      <p>
        No, we haven't. We still use them on some jobs. We can still do
        traditional hot water extraction (steam) cleaning that was popular in
        the past. We just prefer delivering a better clean with less impact on
        your family or the environment. We have packages and options to fit
        every need, from light maintenance to complete restorative carpet
        cleaning.

  <h3 class="content-tagline">How Often Should I Clean My Carpet?</h3>
  <div class="breaker"></div>
  <div class="body-columns">
    <div class="col col-text-2">
      <p>
        The age old question, how often does your carpet need to be cleaned? The
        honest answer is; it depends on the following:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>What type of carpet is it?</li>
        <li>How is it used?</li>
        <li>Is it well cared for?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We recommend every 3-6 months cleaning on very high traffic or homes
        with pets. If your carpet has regular traffic, we suggest every 6 months
        to 1 year. Carpet manufacturers generally require every 12 to 18 months
        to maintain most manufacturers' warranties. We encourage you to refer to
        your purchase agreement.

        Your home's carpet acts as a filter to capture dust, dander, plant
        matter, debris, allergens, mold, and other airborne contaminants. Just
        like the filter in your air conditioner, it needs to be emptied
        occasionally. Cleaning your carpet will remove most indoor allergens and
        soils that are trapped in it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The longer it is between cleanings, the more cleaning effort it takes to
        empty the filter. Not only is this expensive, but it brings additional
        cleaning agents into the home and environment and creates more wear and
        tear on the carpet.

        Decker's Carpet Cleaning takes your health seriously. We only use
        products that are safe for your family and your pets. We reduce carbon
        emissions by developing our low moisture system and relying less on
        gasoline-powered truck-mounts. We take steps inside your home as well,
        such as moving the nightstands to clean out the dust in the sleeping
        zone.

        Your carpet will degrade over time with wear. Soil embedded in the
        carpet will speed this process. Each tiny particle of loose soil in your
        carpet will act as a piece of glass or sandpaper, scratching and
        abrading the fiber and causing visible damage. Sticky soils, oils,
        colored spots, and soaps continue to work their way into the carpet over
        time, attracting more soil while embedding themselves deeper in the
        fiber.

        Frequent vacuuming and regular professional carpet cleaning will slow
        the signs of aging for your carpet and prolong its life. Carpets can
        last 2 to 3 times longer or more, even if you have a good carpet
        maintenance program.

      <p>
        Believe it or not, the soil in carpet has been analyzed by carpet mills
        to understand better how to construct better carpet in the future. We
        benefit from studies in the carpet cleaning industry by knowing what
        types of contamination we are removing. Here are the top 10 soils in
        carpets:
      </p>
      <ol class="whitetext">
        <li>Sand, clay and other "gritty" materials</li>
        <li>Natural fibers such as lint from clothing</li>
        <li>Oil, Grease, Petroleum</li>
        <li>Human hair and skin particles</li>
        <li>Dust mites, fleas, other insects</li>
        <li>
          Organic soils and materials (minerals and soils from landscaping
          areas, for example)
        </li>
        <li>Gum, ink, paint</li>
        <li>Airborne carbon and automotive exhaust</li>
        <li>Spilled food or beverages</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Apart from these soils, your carpets may also have bacteria, odor, pet
        waste, smoke from fireplaces, candles, cigarettes, or other things.
