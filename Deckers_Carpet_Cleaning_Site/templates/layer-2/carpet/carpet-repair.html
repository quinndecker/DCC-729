        Damaged carpets that are pulling apart at the seams, have holes, or
        small areas of disoloration are common occurrences. These are generally
        the result of pet damage, burns, furniture moving, or bad installation.
        The good news is that you can repair damaged carpets at a fraction of
        the cost of new carpet installation.

        Sometimes it can be challenging to know if you should replace or repair
        the carpet in your home. Your carpets will often display the following
        signs that indicate you require specialist carpet repair services.
      </p>
      <p>These include:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Wear and Tear</li>
        <li>Frayed Edges and Seams</li>
        <li>Carpet Rips</li>
        <li>Pet Damage</li>
        <li>Burns</li>
        <li>Bleach Spots</li>
        <li>Permanent Stains</li>
        <li>Discoloration</li>
        <li>De-lamination</li>
      </ul>

  <div class="breaker-2"></div>
  <div class="body-columns">
    <div class="col col-text-2">
      <p>
        Do you have carpet tears and shredded carpet? We can install a carpet
        patch - called a Bonded Insert - to replace a damaged area of carpet.
        Bonded inserts are called such because the area of carpet is inserted
        into the existing field of carpeting and bonded into place using heated
        glue and firm backing materials. They are generally stronger than any
        other type of patch and can sometimes be stronger than the carpet around
        the area.
        <br /><br />
        Do you have burns or small spots that wore a hole? We can repair that
        carpet with a patch - or bonded insert - as well. If you have damage
        from pets, kids or wear, bleach spots, stains that won't be removed,
        damage from office chairs, de-lamination or other discoloration, we can
        replace the stained or torn area.
        <br /><br />
        We can work with tufted carpet, Berber carpet, residential carpet,
        commercial carpet, apartment carpet, and some specialty carpets too! We
        have replaced where cash register desks sat in retail environments.
