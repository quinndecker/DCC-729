        especially important with Stone Floors as natural stone is uniquely

        Stone floors have been a popular choice for indoor flooring and accents
        since the Ancient Greeks first used it in their architecture. The use of
        stone in our homes and shared spaces spans over time and over the globe,
        and has proven to be a durable choice. Stone has the benefit of being a
        natural product, has a long expected life span, and has natural beauty
        and characteristics unique to each piece of stone that evokes a sense of
        the region where it originated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Natural stone floors and engineered stone floors can be made of many
        different materials, including epoxy resins and dyes.. The most common
        stone floors are Marble, Travertine, Limestone, and Slate, but there are
        other styles of stone floors as well. There are granite floors, mica
        floors, flagstone floors, concrete floors, onyx floors, bluestone
        floors, soapstone floors, quartz and quartzite floors, terrazzo floors,
        marble conglomerate floors, and there are also clay saltillo tile floors
        and brick floors. Each of these materials require different treatment
        methods to bring out the unique qualities of each type of flooring.

    <div class="col col-text-2">
      <p>
        Every Stone Cleaning begins with a thorough evaluation of the floor to
        be cleaned. First, we determine the type of stone your floor is made of.
        Whether it be travertine, marble, limestone, slate, terrazo, saltillo,
        flagstone, or anything else, we can handle it all. Next, we inspect the
        floor for any installation or wear issues that may prevent us from
        safely cleaning the floor. We look for loose or hollow tiles, cracks,
        missing or damgaed grout, pitting, and properly caulked edges. Sometimes
        the installation will prevent us from safely cleaning the floor, and we
        would rather you know that up front and save the money and wait for
        replacement. We also look for any topical sealers that may have been
        applied to the floor. these can cause issues with cleaning if not caught
        early and may require stripping the sealer off before we can begin the
        cleaning process.
      </p>
      <p>
        After our inspection, the floor will be swept and vacuumed, surrounding
        areas will be protected with corner guards, drop cloths and plastic
        sheeting to prevent cleaning solutions from going anywhere but the floor
        to be cleaned. Once the area has been prepared, we will apply the
        appropriate cleaning solution for whichever type of stone makes up your
        floor. We use a neutral or alkaline cleaning solution depending on the
        situation and our test results. The cleaning solution is carefully
        mopped on to ensure proper, even application over every inch of your
        floor without splashing appliances or other flooring. Every detail is
        accounted for as your floor is gently scrubbed with counter rotating
        brushes to release soils without damaging the stone surface, and
        specialty grout brushes for hand detailing the grout lines, edges and
        corners.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the soils are suspended in our cleaning solution, your floor will
        be rinsed using our truck mounted stone cleaning machine with sufficient
        vacuum and pressure to blast away soils from the surface and extract
        soil from deep in the stone. All of the dirty water is carried away to
        the waste tank in our van - removing soil, bacteria, mold, food
        particles, dust and allergens, and whatever else lurks on your stone
        floor. We work in small batch areas to be sure we properly rinse the
        stone of any soap and soil residue, overlapping multiple times to ensure
        a consistent and even clean. As we move through the house, we will place
        industrial air movers on the clean stone to speed up the drying process.
        Once the floor is dry, we will perform a post cleaning inspection to
        ensure the results are to our standards.

        It is important to remember that there are cases when this process does
        not go far enough to achieve the desired results for your stone.
        Cleaning will remove soils embedded in the stone and grout lines, but
        will not return the stone to its' optimal shine in the case of marble,
        and some travertine floors. For this we recommend

        Some stone floors, such as slate and limestone, look amazing with a
        color enhancing seal to bring out the deep colors in the stone. You can

        Restorative cleaning is sometimes necessary when a stone has been
        neglected or improperly treated over time. Restorative cleaning can
        involve different, more aggressive cleaning styles or solutions or
        multiple cleaning attempts, use of stripping agents, or mechanical
        agitation. If your stone floor has a topical coating that is flaking
        off, efflorescence, or a color seal in the grout that is damaged, it may
        need more than just a cleaning.

  <h2 class="content-tagline">Stone Cleaning FAQ</h2>
  <div class="breaker"></div>
  <br />
  <h3 class="whitetext">Why should I professionally clean my stone floor?</h3>
  <p class="whitetext">
    Like with tile floors, the grout lines in your stone floor are porous and
    hold dirt, grime, oil, soil, bacteria, and all sorts of gross stuff. Unlike
    with tile, the stone tiles themselves are also porous and will hold on to
    soils as well. Mopping your floor helps to remove some of the surface soil,
    but also allows wet soil to soak deeper into the porous stone and grout
    lines. Any un-rinsed residue can attract soil and quickly cause your floor
    to appear stained. We are able to use various cleaning solutions and methods
    including heat, pressure, and vacuum to pull deep soils away and leave you
    with beautiful floors. Many times we are able to remove years of soil.
  </p>
  <br />
  <h3 class="whitetext">
    How often should I professionally clean my stone floors?
  </h3>
  <p class="whitetext">
    We recommend cleaning and sealing your stone floors every one to three
    years, with every year being best to maintain the floor long term. Different
    homes, and different types of stone require different actual levels of
    professional maintenance. Keeping your stone clean will protect it from
    deterioration and will keep future maintenance costs lower, as well as
    improve the beauty of your home.
  </p>
  <br />
  <h3 class="whitetext">Should I seal my stone floors?</h3>
  <p class="whitetext">
    Yes, proper professional sealing of your stone will prevent slow penetration
    of oil and water based stains. The sealer will not stop your floor from
    getting dirty, but it will help to prevent stains and make your mopping and
    each professional cleaning easier. Most sealers are rated to last a few
    years, and with a good professional maintenance plan, can keep your floors
    looking new indefinitely. You can read more about our
    <a class="whitelinks" href="/stone-sealers/">Stone Sealers</a>
    here.
  </p>
  <br />
  <h3 class="whitetext">What should I use to clean my stone floors myself?</h3>
  <p class="whitetext">
    We recommend a neutral pH floor cleaning for your regular maintenance. A
    neutral pH floor cleaner will be easy to use, requires minimal rinsing, and
    will decrease the frequency you will need professional cleaning.
  </p>
  <br />
  <h3 class="whitetext">What should I NOT use on my tile floors?</h3>
  <p class="whitetext">
    Using alkaline soaps, or soaps with oils in them will leave a residue that
    will at best, attract soil, and at worst can permanently damage your stone
    through etching. This dirt magnet will soak into your grout lines every time
    you mop, making future cleaning more difficult and more expensive.
    <br />
    Never use a product with wax, or a product that promises any sort of SHINE.
    This is a topical coating. Never seal your stone floor with any topical
    sealer or coating. It will fail and need to be removed with harsh strippers
    in a tedious and expensive process.
  </p>
  <br />
  <h3 class="whitetext">Will Stone Floor Cleaning make my floor Shine?</h3>
  <p class="whitetext">
    No, cleaning stone floors will not make the floor shine. This is a separate
    process known as Honing and Polishing. In short, cleaning will remove dirt
    and soils, and must be done before honing and polishing can take place.
    Honing will remove deep scratches and imperfections, preparing the floor for
    polishing. Polishing gives you that shine that many homeowners look for in a
    stone floor. You can learn more about our Stone Floor Honing and Polshing
