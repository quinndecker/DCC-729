        No matter how much we love our pets, there's no denying that they can be
        a handful at times, and little accidents are part and parcel of living
        with pets. If you have a young puppy or a cat, you may have some trouble
        litter training them. Sometimes your four legged friends, whether they
        are allowed to or not, can climb on your sofa leaving pet hair and
        dander behind. In some cases they may have even had accidents on, or
        marked their territory on the corners of your favorite chair. Even
        though you clean the area as fast as possible at home, these accidents
        can still leave stains and odors behind.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's something that comes with the territory, literally, in the case of
        dogs. Your furry little friends may repeatedly be urinating in the same
        spot no matter how much you scold and punish them. However, it's an
        ingrained habit for them as that is how they "mark their territory," but
        when this frequently happens on your furniture, it can cause serious
        problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        The urine and feces may get soaked into the furniture, where it can
        penetrate the fibers and contaminate the padding underneath. So, when
        you need help keeping your furniture clean after your pet has done their
        "business" all over it, turn to Decker's Carpet Cleaning for
        professional pet stain and odor treatment.

        At Decker's Carpet Cleaning, our technicians have the technology,
        products, and know how to remediate any horrid smells emanating from
        your upholstery due to pet urine, dander, vomit, or feces. We use
        eco-friendly solutions with no harmful chemicals taking advantage of
        advanced biotechnology combined with powerful natural molecular
        technology to eliminate all unwanted stains and odors.

      <h3 class="whitetext">The Nitty Gritty on Urine Treatment</h3>
      <p>
        There are two sources of odor that can be associated with pet urine, and
        both need to be addressed when removing odors. When pets urinate on your
        sofa, sectional, loveseat, chairs, or other upholstered furniture, there
        is a chemical reaction that takes place. Urine starts as an acidic
        substance, but as it dries, it crystallizes into an alkaline salt
        deposit that is not water soluable and cannot be cleaned out with soaps,
        shampoos, or our standard upholstery cleaning solutions and require
        special urine focused cleaning solutions to break down. These salt
        deposits also attract bacteria that feed on the salts. As this process
        happens gases and waste materials created by this process give off a
        horrid smell that can quickly become unbearable and hard to forget. Most
        other treatment methods for urine stains and odors, especially household
        cleaning products you can buy in the store marketed for "pet stain and
        odor treatment", only attack one of these issues. Most of these products
        are heavy soaps with enzymes to kill the bacteria. There are three main
        problems with this:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>
          Soaps/ Shampoos/ Spot Cleaners are on the alkaline side of the pH
          scale, meaning they will not do anything to break down the alkaline
          salt deposit in the upholstery
        </li>
        <li>
          Enzymes on their own can be a helpful tool, but there is more to the
          picture. Even when enzymes are used to kill off the bacteria present,
          they do not do anything to break down the salt deposit. Since the salt
          deposit is still there, more bacteria will become attracted to the
          area, causing the problem to continue
        </li>
        <li>
          These products are generally very hard to rinse out and can leave
          soapy deposits in the upholstery, leading to dirt and soils sticking
          to the spot on top of the urine issue that is already present. They
          can also cause discoloration of the fibers or setting the stain in
          some materials such as cotton or linen.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Our advanced, cutting-edge urine remidiation solutions attack the
        problem at the source. We use a solution that breaks down the salt
        deposit, killing the bacteria and removing its' food source so no future
        bacteria come to repopulate and restart the odor problems. Not only
        that, these products are formulated to remove the yellowing, or
        sometimes greying stains present from pet accidents. Sometimes
        additional enzymes, or tannin stain removal treatments are necessary on
        top of our Standard Urine Treatment, and our technicians have the know
        how to let you know what needs to be done on site, so we can address the
        issue the first time.

        treatments. Here are some of the methods we use for pet stain and odor

          urine deposits, removing stains and odors
        </li>
        <li>
          Low Moisture Encapsulation Cleaning that encapsulates urine spots and
          allows for removal through the use of an absorbant pad, speeding up
          dry times
        </li>
        <li>
          Additional Deodorizer that neutralizes odor causing molecules, not
          just cover them up
        </li>
        <li>
          Subsurface treatment options for localized, heavy repeated areas
        </li>
