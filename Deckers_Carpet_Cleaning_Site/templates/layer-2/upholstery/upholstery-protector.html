        Nothing beats the feeling of freshly cleaned upholstery. Your home will
        be more enjoyable when you have odor-free, clean sofas, loveseats,
        chairs, and other pieces of upholstered furniture that look brand new.
        Unfortunately, most freshly cleaned upholstery won't stay in that
        condition for long. Sometimes, the opposite happens, as your clean and
        fresh upholstery is more likely to get ruined or dirty by an accidental
        spill.

        At Decker's Carpet Cleaning, we provide you with the perfect way to
        preserve your clean and fresh upholstery for years. By applying

        Upholstery Protector applied by Decker's Carpet Cleaning helps protect
        against stains and fiber distortion from daily use on all materials of
        upholstery. Upholstery Protector is particularly useful for protecting
        against staining and wear on natural fibers such as cotton or linen, and
        synthetic fibers such as microfiber, polyester, nylon, rayon and
        chenille. We can protect any piece of upholstered furniture, such as
        your sofa, loveseat, sectional, chair, recliner, dining chair, ottoman,
        fabric bench, upholstered bedframes, and even mattresses.

        Decker's Carpet Cleaning's upholstery protectors can be added to your
        upholstery cleaning service whenever you desire. That will create an
        invisible shield around the fibers of your upholstery, which will allow
        them to repel dirt effectively. You won't need to worry about staining
        your sofa after having them cleaned and looking fresh with

        directly after your upholstery is cleaned, you ensure that anything that
        spills on your sofa, loveseat, sectional, or chair is less likely to
        leave a stain and will be easier to clean as well. We believe that
        upholstery protectors are worth every penny, especially if you're
        interested in extending your furniture's lifespan.

    Why Do You Need Upholstery Protectors like Green Guard?
  </h2>
  <div class="breaker-2"></div>
  <div class="body-columns">
    <div class="col col-text-2">
      <p>
        Most people don't believe in buying upholstery protectors as they feel
        it is an unnecessary expense. There's nothing wrong with that, except
        for one small issue; when you leave your freshly cleaned sofa, chair,
        sectional, or loveseat unprotected, it's more vulnerable to spills,
        dirt, accidents, and pet issues. An unprotected upholstered piece of
        furniture will absorb all the spills and dirt directly into the fibers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the course of time between cleanings, the dirt and soils that
        accumulate can actually cause abrasion and distortion of the fibers.
        This is generally the cause of dark spots on the head, arms or seat of
        your favorite spots on the sofa, or in that comfy chair. Upholstery
        protectors will form a protective layer around the fibers, leaving them
        resistant to physical damage such as abrasion and distortion, helping
        you keep your upholstery looking fresh for years.
