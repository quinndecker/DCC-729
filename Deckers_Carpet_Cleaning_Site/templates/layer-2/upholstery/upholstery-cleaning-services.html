        <br /><br />Your furniture, including your upholstery and mattresses,
        collects dust, dust mites and their droppings, hair, pet dander, plant
        particles, bacteria, smoke from cigarettes or cooking, oils from cooking
        and skin, and many other things that you would rather not expose
        yourself to. Decker's Carpet Cleaning offers upholstery and mattress
        cleaning services, including advanced stain removal, fabric protection,
        and upholstery repair. <br /><br />Next time you snuggle up on the
        sectional, have guests on your dining chairs, or invite over an
        important client to close a deal sitting on your office furniture, just
        think how much better you would feel knowing your furniture is clean,
        healthy, and good looking.

  <h2 class="content-tagline">Upholstery Cleaning FAQ</h2>
  <div class="breaker"></div>
  <br />
  <h3 class="whitetext">How clean is your furniture?</h3>
  <p class="whitetext">
    Here's a quick test. Can you see dust and debris on your furniture? Are
    there visible soils, stains, water marks, spills, or dark oily spots? If so,
    you may be due for a cleaning. Next time you vacuum, take the vacuum hose
    and a black material and vacuum your upholstery through the black material.
    The white residue you see is dust, dust mites and their droppings, hair, pet
    dander, plant particles, smoke particles and other environmental debris.
  </p>
  <br />
  <h3 class="whitetext">What types of upholstered furniture can be cleaned?</h3>
  <p class="whitetext">
    Decker's Carpet Cleaning can clean your nylon, polyester, microfiber,
    leather, cotton, silk, rayon, acrylic, or other type of fabric. We can clean
    furniture marked “W”, “S” , “D”, or just about any classification of
    furniture. Do you have a special textile? Call us, and we will be happy to
    help. We clean mattresses, headboards, upholstered bed rails, stools,
    ottoman, chairs, loveseats, chaise lounges, oversized chairs, recliners,
    gliders, easy chairs, La-Z-Boys, BarcaLoungers, couches, sofas, sectionals,
    benches, window seats, barstools, dining chairs, church chairs, folding
    chairs, office chairs, church pews, R.V. upholstery, auto interior, boat
    interior, hippie bus interior, reclining furniture, cat trees, settes,
    futons, and any other upholstery not listed.
  </p>
  <br />
  <h3 class="whitetext">How often should upholstery be cleaned?</h3>
  <p class="whitetext">
    Everyday use upholstery, including mattresses, should be cleaned every six
    months to two years, or as needed when you can see it is soiled. It largely
    depends on the amount and type of use, but also on the textile. Spot
    cleaning upholstery can cause water marks and permanent damage, so before
    you clean a spot, read the label and call us for advice.
  </p>
  <br />
  <h3 class="whitetext">
    Should Upholstery be protected with a fabric protector?
  </h3>
  <p class="whitetext">
    Of course, one of the best ways to extend the life of your upholstery after
    cleaning is to clean it frequently and protect the fabric with a quality
    protector. Decker's Carpet Cleaning offers Green Guard upholstery protector
    to safely seal in the clean. Green Guard works to seal in the clean with a
    layer of dye blocking nanoparticles while serving to defend against acid
    dyes and water or oil based stains.<br />Simply put, your upholstery will
    stay cleaner longer, is defended against stains, and will clean easier and
    better on the next regular professional cleaning.
