        Area rugs are a beautiful addition to any house. They help contribute to
        a room's overall ambiance, character, and vibe, much like fine paintings
        and wall décor. However, they must be clean and in exquisite condition
        to complete the furnishing and look of any room you want to decorate.
        Unlike paintings and wall decorations, area rugs are on the ground,
        meaning they have to withstand a lot of foot traffic.
        <br /><br />
        They are primarily placed in areas where high footfalls and traffic will
        liven up the space and give it a distinct look. However, that means you
        must also be prepared to protect and clean any rugs to give them a
        pristine and not worn-out look. The best part about area rugs is that
        apart from adding to the décor of any room, they also act as an air
        filtration system.

        Area rugs can do a great job at trapping allergens, dirt, and dust
        particles in any room and help to prevent unhealthy particles from
        circulating in the room and around the house. However, they will only be
        able to do this job if kept clean and well-maintained. The air
        filtration system in your house needs to be replaced or cleaned
        regularly to keep performing its job. <br /><br />
        Your upholstery, carpets, and area rugs also need to be cleaned
        regularly, and the professionals at Decker's Carpet Cleaning are up for
        that job. We focus on attention to detail and clean your area rugs with
        extreme care and precision, ensuring they are restored to their natural
        beauty. Our team employs cutting-edge techniques, tools, and processes
        for area rug cleaning to remove all non-living allergens, bacteria, and
        dirt from your oriental and area rugs.

        At Decker's Carpet Cleaning, we provide an extensive range of methods
        and techniques for area rug cleaning, ensuring that your area rug is not
        damaged in any way. Our technicians are experts and masters at cleaning
        carpets and area rugs, restoring them to a pristine condition that will
        delight you. We can clean almost any rug - from antique oriental rugs to
        everyday polyester rugs. While all area rugs require care that goes
        beyond standard wall to wall carpet, Wool rugs - and even more so, Silk
        rugs - require exceptional skill and precision. <br /><br />
        Our area rug cleaning processes have been designed, factoring in all the
        variables that may impact any area rug's softness, color, texture, and
        look. Our technicians understand what goes into cleaning an area rug and
        know that they must be treated delicately and carefully. These are
        pieces of art and are worth an incredible amount of investment, which is
        why we will never let you down. <br /><br />

  <h2 class="content-subheaders">How We Clean Area Rugs</h2>
  <div class="breaker-2"></div>
  <p class="whitetext">
    We have two main options for area rug cleaning. In Plant cleaning in which
    your area rug is picked up by our technicians and taken to be cleaned in a
    rug bath, and On Site cleaning, or cleaning performed in your home.

        In Plant Cleaning
      </h3>
      <p style="text-align: center">
        We recommend In Plant cleaning for most area rugs as it is the most
        thorough cleaning option available for area rugs. While all area rugs
        will benefit from an In Plant cleaning, the ones that we highly
        recommend be cleaned using this method are: Wool Rugs, long pile rugs,
        and any rugs with pet damage. Silk rugs must be cleaned In Plant. The
        turnaround time for this process can be between 2-3 weeks. <br /><br />
        A Step By Step Breakdown of our In Plant Area Rug Cleaning Process:

      <ul class="list">
        <li>Pre Inspection</li>
        <li>
          2-step dry soil removal using a rug badger to remove excess dirt and
          soils going beyond what can be achieved from vacuuming the face of the
          rug, followed by a HEPA filtered vacuuming
        </li>
        <li>
          Dye-Blocking - ensures that the colors in your area rug maintain and
          do not bleed during the cleaning process

        <li>
          Pre-Condition the area rug with cleaning solutions formulated for the
          specific fiber content of the rug
        </li>
        <li>
          Agitate by hand using a carpet groomer to break surface tension and
          work the solution evenly yet gently into the deep recesses of the area
          rug
        </li>
        <li>
          Deflocculate - allow the cleaning solution to break down oily, sticky
          soils into fine particles
        </li>

        On Site Cleaning
      </h3>
      <p style="text-align: center">
        On Site area rug cleaning is performed in the home using a hot water
        extraction method with a truck mounted extraction machine. The process
        for on site cleaning mirrors our process for Hot Water Extraction on
        wall to wall installed carpet, but is adapted to the unique challenges
        faced by the construction of area rugs in contrast to wall to wall
        carpet. <br /><br />
        A Step By Step Breakdown of our On Site Area Rug Cleaning Process:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>
          Pre-Inspection of the area rug to determine fiber content and weave
        </li>
        <li>
          2-step dry soil removal using a counter rotating brush to lift pile
          and achieve a more effective vacuuming(when fiber content allows us to
          do so), followed by a HEPA filtered vacuuming
        </li>

        <li>
          Rinse and extract using our high powered truck mounted carpet cleaning

  <div class="body-columns">
    <div class="col col-text-2">
      <p>
        Whenever you notice your area rugs starting to show wear, or a new spot
        or spill appears, it may be tempting to run to the pantry and reach for
        that at home spot treatment spray or rent a DIY carpet cleaner. These
        options are generally not the way to go when it comes to maintaining
        your area rugs, or wall to wall carpet for that matter. One of the main
        problems with most at home treatments is that they are very soapy and
        tend to leave sticky residue behind, causing even more dirt and soils to
        stick to that spot. In some cases, depending on the material and dye of
        the rug, these products can cause color loss, bleaching, or bleeding of
        the dyes. One of the worst examples of this is anything with peroxide
        can actually destroy Wool Rug fibers. It is generally a safer choice for
        your area rug to be cleaned by a professional who has the tools,
        products, and know-how to handle almost any area rug cleaning situation.
